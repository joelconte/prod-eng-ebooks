Jenn\n"March 1998."-Cover\nThesis (M.S. in Electrical Engineering) Naval Postgraduate School, March 1998\nIncludes bibliographical references (p. 47)\nThe objective of this thesis is to investigate and evaluate the effectiveness of radar cross section (RCS) reduction by means of the geometric control of discontinuities using serrated edges. Although the use of serrated edges for RCS reduction can be clearly seen on stealth aircraft such as the Northrop B-2, and was mentioned in several papers and references, not much data on the reduction magnitude, the associated geometry, or the design methodology are available in the open literature. Parameters of interest include the number of basic serration cells (triangles) required per wavelength, and the aspect ratio of the triangles that form the zig zags. An infinitely thin metallic plate is considered for the analysis. The RCS of such a plate with serrated edges is computed and compared against the RCS of a plate of the same sized without serrated edges. The infinitely thin assumption is valid if the wing of the aircraft, which is represented by the plate, is thin compared to the wavelength. The results obtained show significant reduction in RCS\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat reader\nSingapore Ministry of Defense author (civilian)\ndk/dk cc\:9116 9/1/98\n

description2625=This article is from BMC Medical Research Methodology , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: Identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for effective implementation of type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention programs. Several studies have shown that multivariable predictive functions perform as well as the 2-hour post-challenge glucose in identifying these high-risk individuals. The performance of these functions in Asian populations, where the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is expected to be the greatest in the next several decades, is relatively unknown. Methods\: Using data from three Asian populations in Singapore, we compared the performance of three multivariate predictive models in terms of their discriminatory power and calibration quality\: the San Antonio Health Study model, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities model and the Framingham model. Results\: The San Antonio Health Study and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities models had better discriminative powers than using only fasting plasma glucose or the 2-hour post-challenge glucose. However, the Framingham model did not perform significantly better than fasting glucose or the 2-hour post-challenge glucose. All published models suffered from poor calibration. After recalibration, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities model achieved good calibration, the San Antonio Health Study model showed a significant lack of fit in females and the Framingham model showed a significant lack of fit in both females and males. Conclusions\: We conclude that adoption of the ARIC model for Asian populations is feasible and highly recommended when local prospective data is unavailable.

In addition, it includes evaluation studies and specific service leadership programs, making it a pioneering book that integrates service leadership and student wellbeing for Chinese university students. In view of the transformation of industries resulting in shifts from manufacturing economies to service economies, the book takes a holistic approach to leadership development, focusing on three basic components of effective service leadership that are closely related to student wellbeing\: leadership competencies such as emotional intelligence and resilience, moral character, and a caring disposition. This approach represents a move away from literature that emphasizes the elite leadership model, assuming that leadership is the privilege of a talented few. By extension, it argues that the promotion of service leadership qualities is a good strategy for promoting student wellness. The individual chapters are extended versions of papers presented at the “International Conference on Service Leadership Education for University Students\: Experience in Hong Kong,” which was held in May 2014. The book offers a valuable contribution to Chinese and global academic literature on service leadership and will benefit researchers and educators alike\n
description2621=The Keeley Consulting Group leitete vor kurzem bestimmte Bewertungen in Bezug auf die Politikentwicklung. Es stellt sich heraus, dass eine Organisation braucht, um eine klar definierte und sorgfältig geschrieben Politik, um eine gesellige, ermutigend, organisierten, sicheren und unvoreingenommene Arbeitsplatz gewährleisten zu konstruieren. Im Grunde eine Menge von uns nicht gerne eine inkonsistente und nicht konsequent angewendet Politik. Sie führen häufig zu Problemen bei der Oberseite der, die sie entworfen wurden, zu lösen. Allerdings Politik sind ein wichtiger Bestandteil eines jeden Unternehmens. Sie definieren die erforderlichen Leitlinien für Unternehmen, um richtig arbeiten und Einfluss auf das Verhalten von Individuen zu einem bestimmten Ergebnis. Bitte beachten Sie die folgenden Tipps von The Keeley Consulting Group, wie man neue Strategien für Ihr Unternehmen zu entwickeln. Erstens sorgen dafür, dass es eine Politik der Politik. Wir wissen, dass es klingt ein wenig überflüssig, aber es notwendig, innerhalb einer vorgegebenen Arbeit und beschlossen Rahmen, auch wenn es um Politikgestaltung geht. Wahrscheinlich der erste und wichtigste Schritt in reifenden Politik ist es, eine einfache Politik Politik, die Verfahren der Organisation für die Erstellung neuer Richtlinien klärt machen. Diese Politik sollte der Beratung über das, was Situationen stellen die Notwendigkeit einer neuen Politik, das Format, das neue Politiken zu nutzen, sowie die Verfahren, die befolgt werden für eine neue Politik zu genehmigen hat bestehen. Es gibt eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Sie eine große Inkonsequenz in den Ergebnissen und Inkonsistenz in der Schöpfung, wenn Sie nicht über ein Verfahren und ein Rahmen um die Politikgestaltung. Dies könnte auch in armen oder schwierige Durchsetzung führen. Zweitens erkennen Überschneidungen mit bestehenden Politiken. Sie müssen sorgfältig prüfen, ob die Richtlinie, die Sie planen, zu erstellen bereits existiert oder sie Teile davon in anderen Politikbereichen vorhanden ist, bevor Sie eine neue Richtlinie zu erstellen. Wenn das der Fall ist, sollten Sie der Überarbeitung bestehender Richtlinien, anstatt eine neue zu erstellen. Drittens, die Richtlinie nicht in einem Vakuum zu schaffen haben. Die Keeley Consulting Group zeigt, dass Politik sollte mit dem Input von denen, die von ihnen nicht hinter Ihrem Schreibtisch betroffen sein werden, entwickelt und machen Politik, die Sie fühlte waren notwendig, und dass waren ganz auf eigene Faust entwickelt. Es ist wichtig, dass alle Beteiligten zu hören, um die Möglichkeit für zufällige Folgen zu reduzieren, auch wenn die endgültige Politik kann letztlich nicht unbedingt alle Meinungen. Die Politik muss auf jeden Fall vollständig sein und hinzugefügt Meinungen können helfen, schließen Sie alle Lücken, die eventuell existieren. Vierter Schritt zurück und denken über die Notwendigkeit. Bitte denken Sie daran, dass Sie Richtlinien erstellen, wenn es eine klare Notwendigkeit und ein klares Problem zu lösen, nicht nur, weil jemand hat etwas, das man nicht mochte. Laut The Keeley Consulting Group Bewertung wurden einige Maßnahmen an Ort und Stelle aus Trotz und als Rache setzen, und diese Art von Tätigkeit nicht in einer vernünftigen Organisation geschehen. Es wird nicht auch in einer Firma, die eine strenge Politik auf die Politik hat geschehen, als die Politik wird oft durch mehrere Ebenen für die Zulassung zu gehen. Fünftens, nutzen Sie die richtigen Worte, so wird es keine Missverständnisse. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie einfach und spezifische Terminologie zu verwenden, weil Politik sollte leicht zu verstehen, um wirksam zu sein. Wir versehen unten einige wichtige Hinweise\: Nutzen Sie die Worte "Muss" oder "werden" anstatt "sollte" in den Körper der Politik. Wenn etwas ist optional, wird das Wort "sollte", aber nicht, wenn es ist eine Anforderung. Verwenden Sie eine Abteilung, Büro, Einheit oder Jobtitel und nicht den Namen einer Person.   Kontakt E-Mails müssen eine allgemeine Abteilung Adresse oder eine Web-Seite, die zusätzliche Kontaktinformationen ergibt. Bitte vermeiden Sie eine individuelle E-Mail-Adresse, um die Politik von Updates benötigen, wenn personelle Veränderungen passieren zu vermeiden. Unterstreichen Sie nicht hierher oder Wörter, die in einem Satz hervorgehoben werden müssen. Stattdessen setzen Schriften fett oder kursiv, wenn ein Wort muss betont werden. Wenn die Richtlinie ins Netz gestellt, betonte Worte könnten für Hyperlinks verwechselt werden. Sechstens gehören Ausnahmen Prozess wann immer möglich. In den meisten Fällen gibt es eine Ausnahme für jede Regel. Es ist viel einfacher zu erkennen, wie ein Ausnahmeverfahren ist im Voraus zu betreiben, bevor die Richtlinie umgesetzt wird. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Ausnahmen müssen in einer Weise, die gerecht und vernünftig ist, gewährt werden. Die gesamte Politik könnte in Frage gestellt werden, wenn Sie sorglos mit der Ausnahmeprozess waren. Siebtens, ermöglichen einige Grautöne. Die Keeley Consulting Group der Ansicht, dass einige Maßnahmen noch ein wenig Unklarheit lassen für die Menschen, Entscheidungen zu schaffen. Es ist okay, wenn Ihre Politik lässt ein wenig grau, so dass eine Person kann eine On-the-fly-Entscheidung zu treffen. Achtens definieren Politik Wartung verantwortlich. Die meisten Maßnahmen erfordern eine regelmäßige Überprüfung ihrer Anwendbarkeit weiter zu gewährleisten. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie immer das Büro, die für die Politik verantwortlich ist, weil jemand in der Lage, Informationen zu liefern, wenn die Klärung Fragen werden über die Politik erhöht Bedürfnisse zu erkennen. Individuen zu identifizieren, da sie nicht kommen und gehen. Schließlich richten Sie eine Politik Bibliothek Versionierung. Heutzutage gibt es mehrere Tools, mit denen Sie verschiedene Versionen der Dokumente zu speichern. Alle Mitarbeiter sollten in der Lage für den Zugriff auf alle geeigneten Maßnahmen die ganze Zeit. Versionierung kann auch helfen, Menschen, die Geschichte der Politik sehen, zu verfolgen, was sich über die Jahre verändert.

It is intended for an audience of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postgraduate and advanced researchers. This volume focuses on societal pragmatics. One of the main concerns of societal pragmatics is the world of language users. We are interested in the investigation of linguistic practices in the context of societal practices (‘praxis’, to use a term used in the Wittgensteinian and other traditions). It is clear that the world of users, including their practices, their culture, and their social aims has to be taken into account and seriously investigated when we deal with the pragmatics of language. It is not enough to discuss principles of language use solely in the guise of abstract theoretical tools. Consequently, the present volume focuses explicitly on the interplay of abstract, theoretical principles and the necessities imposed by societal contexts often requiring a more flexible use of such theoretical tools. The volume includes articles on pragmemes, politeness and anti-politeness, dialogue, joint utterances, discourse markers, pragmatics and the law, institutional discourse, critical discourse analysis, pragmatics and culture, cultural scripts, argumentation theory, connectives and argumentation, language games and psychotherapy, slurs, the analysis of funerary rites, as well as an authoritative chapter by Jacob L. Mey on societal pragmatics\n

Japan’s Comprehensive and Continual Support Package for the Creation of Scientific Climate Policies in Asia\nThis book presents good practices in Asia and ASEAN countries for effectively promoting advances in response to climate change, which can help to achieve sustainable development in Asia and around the world. As a proposal, the aim is to influence the discussions at COP 21 by providing a positive agenda with concrete actions from an Asian perspective. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 describes the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction scenario from an Asian perspective and in line with global 2 ° targets. Based on modeling analysis, the studies demonstrate the theoretical potentials and send the policymakers at COP 21 the positive message that “Asia can reach the target.” As Asian countries vary in terms of their economic strength, country-specific scenario studies for the two giants China and India as well as for Japan and Vietnam are introduced to show the different approaches for each country.^\nPart 2 shows successful examples of how modeling analysis are reflected in actual policy development, which provides practical guidelines to help policymakers develop their own roadmaps with stakeholder dialogue, not only in Asia but also in other regions of the world. The Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) roadmap development in Thailand as well as the Iskandar Malaysia project show at the country and city level how researchers and policymakers are working closely to succeed. Part 3 focuses on a number of sector-specific activities including transportation, forestry, capacity development, and inventory work in Asia. Rather than discussing the Low Carbon Society (LCS) concept in detail, the respective chapters highlight unique, concrete, and practically applicable examples from Asia, showing how Asian countries are addressing climate change mitigation issues in a collaborative manner, an approach that can be replicated in other regions.^\nWhile the ultimate goal of this book is to facilitate international climate regime making, local government and international organizations (United Nations, World Bank, and others) officers, researchers, international NGO/NPOs, consultants, students (particularly those studying international relationships or environmental studies), as well as reporters will find this book useful in broadening their understanding of low-carbon development in Asia\n

Global in scope, it includes contributions and research projects from Asia, Africa and Latin America. The international scholarly community has taken a variety of approaches to question the impact of information society initiatives on populations in the Global South. This book addresses two aspects— Impact of research\: How is the research on ICTs in the Global South playing a role in creating an information society? (e.g. policy formulation, media coverage, implementation in practice) and Research on impact\: What is the evidence for the impact of ICTs on society? (i.e. the objectives of socio-economic development). This volume brings together a multiplicity of voices and approaches from social scientific research to produce an engaging volume for a variety of stakeholders including academics, researchers, practitioners, policy-makers and those in the business and civil sectors of society\n

Abstract Background\: To measure the content of cholesterol-raising diterpenes in coffee sold at the retailer level in Singapore, Indonesia and India and to determine the relationship of coffee consumption with lipid levels in a population-based study in Singapore. Methods\: Survey and cross-sectional study in local coffee shops in Singapore, Indonesia and India to measure the diterpene content in coffee, and a population-based study in Singapore to examine the relationship of coffee consumption and blood lipid levels. Interviews and coffee samples (n \= 27) were collected from coffee shops in Singapore, Indonesia and India. In addition, 3000 men and women who were Chinese, Malay, and Indian residents of Singapore participated in a cross-sectional study. Results and Discussion\: The traditional 'sock' method of coffee preparation used in Singapore resulted in cafestol concentrations comparable to European paper drip filtered coffee (mean 0.09 ± SD 0.064 mg/cup). This amount would result in negligible predicted increases in serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Similarly low amounts of cafestol were found in Indian 'filter' coffee that used a metal mesh filter (0.05 ± 0.05 mg/cup). Coffee samples from Indonesia using the 'sock' method (0.85 ± 0.41 mg/cup) or a metal mesh filter (0.98 mg/cup) contained higher amounts of cafestol comparable to espresso coffee. Unfiltered coffee from Indonesia contained an amount of cafestol (4.43 mg/cup) similar to Scandinavian boiled, Turkish and French press coffee with substantial predicted increases in serum cholesterol (0.33 mmol/l) and triglycerides (0.20 mmol/l) concentrations for consumption of 5 cups per day. In the Singaporean population, higher coffee consumption was not substantially associated with serum lipid concentrations after adjustment for potential confounders [LDL-cholesterol\: 3.07 (95% confidence interval 2.97-3.18) for

description2610=This article is from Cardiovascular Journal of Africa , volume 25 . Abstract Introduction\: Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) strongly predicts cardiovascular outcomes. We undertook to measure ambulatory CASP in 74 prevalent dialysis patients using the BPro (HealthStats, Singapore) device. We also determined whether coronary or abdominal aortic calcification was associated with changes in CASP and whether interdialytic CASP predicted ambulatory measurement. Methods\: All patients underwent computed tomography for coronary calcium score, lateral abdominal radiography for aortic calcium score, echocardiography for left ventricular mass index and ambulatory blood pressure measurement using BPro calibrated to brachial blood pressure. HealthStats was able to convert standard BPro SOFT® data into ambulatory CASP. Results\: Ambulatory CASP was not different in those without and with coronary (137.6 vs 141.8 mmHg, respectively, p \= 0.6) or aortic (136.6 vs 145.6 mmHg, respectively, p \= 0.2) calcification. Furthermore, when expressed as a percentage of brachial systolic blood pressure to control for peripheral blood pressure, any difference in CASP was abolished\: CASP\: brachial systolic blood pressure ratio \= 0.9 across all categories regardless of the presence of coronary or aortic calcification (p \= 0.2 and 0.4, respectively). Supporting this finding, left ventricular mass index was also not different in those with or without vascular calcification (p \= 0.7 and 0.8 for coronary and aortic calcification). Inter-dialytic office blood pressure and CASP correlated excellently with ambulatory measurements (r \= 0.9 for both). Conclusion\: Vascular calcification was not associated with changes in ambulatory central aortic systolic pressure in this cohort of prevalent dialysis patients. Inter-dialytic blood pressure and CASP correlated very well with ambulatory measurement.

description2602=This article is from Diabetes Care , volume 35 . Abstract \: OBJECTIVE\: To examine the association between early retinal arteriolar abnormalities and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\: Data from 608 people (aged 40–80 years) with diabetes from the population-based Singapore Malay Eye Study were analyzed. Participants underwent binocular two-field digital retinal photography and quantitative sensory testing. DPN was defined as an abnormal response to a monofilament or neurothesiometer test. Quantitative changes of retinal vascular caliber and arteriolar bifurcation geometry were measured using a computer-based program. Qualitative retinal signs of retinopathy and retinal arteriolar wall signs were graded by standardized methods. RESULTS\: DPN was present in 155 people (25.5%). After adjusting for age, sex, diabetes duration, HbA1c, cardiovascular risk factors, antihypertensive medication use, and peripheral arterial disease, people with suboptimal arteriolar caliber (odds ratio 1.94 [95% CI 1.22–3.10]), larger arteriolar branching coefficient (1.58 [1.03–2.42]), diabetic retinopathy (1.82 [1.20–2.75]), and focal arteriolar narrowing (2.92 [1.48–5.76]) were more likely to have DPN. Participants with a greater number of retinal microvascular signs were more likely to have DPN than those without retinal changes (6.11 [2.11–17.71] for two or more signs and 3.47 [1.18–10.21] for one sign compared with none). CONCLUSIONS\: Individuals with diabetes with early retinal arteriolar abnormalities are more likely to have DPN, independent of hyperglycemia and major vascular risk factors. These data support the hypothesis that early microvascular dysfunction, evident in the retina, is an independent risk factor for DPN.

description2563=2,370 Pages of White House, State Department, National Security Council, British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and British Prime Minister's Cabinet Office files on Idi Amin. Idi Amin was born in the 1920's in the West Nile Province.  His name at birth is disputed among researchers. In time he was to be known as Idi Amin Dada. In the 1940's Amin was recruited by a British colonial army officer. Amin joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British colonial army in 1946. Amin took part in the British campaign to prevent the independence of Burma. Later he was deployed in Kenya as part of the 21st KAR infantry brigade against the Mau Mau rebellion until 1949, when his unit was deployed in Somalia to fight the Shifta, who were raiding cattle. Amin was promoted to corporal in 1952, and to sergeant in 1953. The following year, he was made effendi (warrant officer), the highest rank possible for a Black African in the Colonial British army. While in the colonial army, Amin became a Ugandan heavyweight boxing champ. After joining the Ugandan army in 1962, when the colony gained independence from Britain, he quickly rose up the ranks to commander of the armed forces in 1966.  Uganda's strategic position along the central African Rift Valley, its favorable climate and the reliable rainfall around the Lake Victoria Basin made it attractive to African cultivators and herders as early as the fourth century B.C. When Arab traders moved inland from their enclaves along the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa and reached the interior of Uganda in the 1830s, they found several African kingdoms with well-developed political  institutions dating back several centuries. These traders were followed in the 1860s by British explorers searching for the source of the Nile River. Protestant missionaries entered the country in 1877, followed by Catholic missionaries in 1879.  In 1888, control of the emerging British "sphere of interest" in East Africa was assigned by royal charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company, an arrangement strengthened in 1890 by an Anglo-German agreement confirming British dominance over Kenya and Uganda. The high cost of occupying the territory caused the company to withdraw in 1893, and its administrative functions were taken over by a British commissioner. In 1894, the Kingdom of Buganda was placed under a formal British protectorate.  Britain granted internal self-government to Uganda in 1961, with the first elections held on March 1, 1961. Benedicto Kiwanuka of the Democratic Party became the first Chief Minister. Uganda maintained its Commonwealth membership. In succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally based local kingdoms. Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966, when Prime Minister Milton Obote suspended the constitution, assumed all government powers, and removed the president and vice president. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.  On January 25, 1971, Obote's government was ousted in a military coup led by armed forces commander Idi Amin Dada. Amin declared himself president, dissolved the parliament, and amended the constitution to give himself absolute power. He gave himself the title "His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr. Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, Conqueror of the British Empire." Idi Amin Dada took advantage of the turmoil in the military, the weakened popular support for the government, and Obote's absence while attending the meeting of Commonwealth Conference of Heads of Government at Singapore to seize control of the government. Claiming himself to be a professional soldier, not a politician, Amin promoted many of his staunchest supporters, both enlisted personnel and officers, to command positions. Nepotism received widespread publicity, as a number of laborers, drivers, and bodyguards became high-ranking officers, although they had little or no military training. Army recruiters suspended educational requirements for military service, sometimes forcing groups of urban unemployed to volunteer. After the army had established control over the civilian population, Amin unleashed a reign of terror against Uganda that lasted almost until the end of the decade. In 1972, the Asians in Uganda, many of whom had come from other British colonies to work Uganda's plantations as far back as 1912, were given 90 days to leave the country with nothing. The army changed composition under Amin's rule. By 1977 it had grown to 21,000 personnel, almost twice the 1971 level. Amin killed many of its more experienced officers and imprisoned others for plotting to weaken or overthrow his regime. A few fled the country rather than face the mounting danger. Amin also increased the number of military recruits from other countries, especially Sudan, Zaire, and Rwanda. By 1979 foreigners accounted for nearly 75 percent of the army, exacerbating problems of communication, training, and discipline. The government barely controlled some army units. A few became quasi-independent occupation garrisons, headed by violence-prone warlords who lived off the land by brutalizing the local population. Idi Amin's 8-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The Acholi and Langi tribes were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because Obote and many of his supporters belonged to those tribes and constituted the largest group in the army.  Amin established several powerful internal security forces, including the State Research Bureau (SRB) and Public Safety Unit (PSU). Both terrorized local populations. By 1979 they had expanded to include about 15,000 people, many of whom acted as informers on fellow citizens. The SRB and PSU were responsible for many deaths. Their victims included people from all segments of society , who were accused of speaking or acting against the regime. One official observer estimated that two-thirds of Uganda's technocrats died or fled into exile during the 1970s. Amin also ordered the expulsion of the country's Asian community, which numbered approximately 70,000. These and other excesses drained the nation's human and financial resources; cash crop cultivation dwindled, most manufacturing ceased, and the economy collapsed. Social services, local government, and public works activities were almost non-existent.  In 1978, the International Commission of Jurists estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror; some authorities place the figure much higher, as high as 500,000.  Ugandan exiles told tales of severed heads kept in Idi Amin's refrigerator and the feeding of corpses to crocodiles.  It has been reported that bodies were dumped into the River Nile because there were insufficient graves. At one point, so many bodies were fed to crocodiles that remains sometimes blocked intake ducts at the country's hydroelectric plant at Jinja. Amin has been accused of having one of his wives dismembered. He was also accused of cannibalism.  Amin sought strong ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The former Israeli embassy in Uganda was offered to them as headquarters. on June 27, 1976 Air France Flight 139 was hijacked and invited to Uganda by Amin. The plane landed at Entebbe International Airport in the city of Entebbe. The hijackers agreed to the release of non-Jewish and non-Israeli passengers. At midnight on July 3, 1976, Israeli commandos attacked the airport and freed all but two of the remaining hostages. One was killed by the Israeli forces, while another, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, who had been taken to a hospital before the rescue, was killed under Amin's direct orders by two army officers after the hostage rescue. By late 1978, Amin had laid the groundwork for his downfall by eliminating many moderate political and military leaders. His actions intensified rivalries within the army, which destroyed the alliance among factions from the northwest who had remained loyal to Amin. Sudanese and Kakwa soldiers then sought to weaken each other's influence, leading to violent disputes and mutinies within commands. To defuse these tensions, Amin deployed the rebellious Suicide Battalion from Masaka and the Simba Battalion from Mbarara to annex an 1,800-square kilometer strip of Tanzanian territory north of the Kagera River, known as the Kagera Salient. Tanzania's president, Julius Nyerere, responded with force, and within two months the Tanzanian People's Defence Force (TPDF) had expelled the Ugandans. On November 14, 1978, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to invade Uganda and oust Amin. About 1,000 Ugandans who had been in exile in Tanzania and had organized themselves into the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) accompanied the TPDF invasion force. The TPDF-UNLA force numbered about 45,000. They launched a two-pronged attack supported by long-range artillery. One group captured the southern town of Masaka near Lake Victoria; the other advanced to the west of Masaka, moving northward through Mbarara and then east to Kampala.  By mid-March 1979, about 2,000 Libyan troops and several hundred Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) fighters had joined in the fight to save Amin's regime; however, this intervention failed to stop the TPDF-UNLA force. Entire garrisons of government troops mutinied or deserted when they realized that Amin would lose his hold on the government.  Finally, on April 10, 1979, Kampala fell. Amin went into exile in Tripoli, Libya, and approximately 8,000 of his soldiers retreated into Sudan and Zaire.  Amin later took refuge in Saudi Arabia, living with his four wives, where he died on August 16, 2003.

Telegrams date from March 1973 to December 1974. State Department cables from the State Archiving System (SAS), dealing with General Idi Amin and Uganda. These records are popularly known as the "State Department Cables" or the "State Department Telegrams".  These records were part of the State Department Central Foreign Policy Files.

The materials relate to all aspects of American bilateral and multilateral foreign relations and routine administrative and operational activities of the Department of State and its Foreign Service posts, related to subjects involving General Idi Amin and Uganda. The telegrams convey official information about policy proposals and implementation, program activities, or personnel and post operations between the Department of State and posts abroad.

When the volume and content of the messages reached the breaking point, it prompted a State Department official to write that the messages should be responded to with a, ìcurt explanation  something as follows\:  Quote the White House has instructed us to return this message to you as it is unacceptable. In content and tone it is wholly undignified as a communication between chiefs of state of countries which, on our side at least, are attempting to maintain friendly relations. Please return the message to your president with that explanation. Unquoteî Plans of Amin to attend the 1973 United Nations General Assembly at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

Wait till you hear this speech.í Etiang said he had tried to persuade the general to moderate his language and to cut down the length, as UN would not stand for such a speech. Prattley is rather down on Etiang these days and says he doesnít do as much as he might to try to influence the general but just sits there and listens to Amin's idiocies. Prattley said Etiang "wants out" and asked him if he could find him a job somewhere with the UN. Accounts of Aminís television addresses to the people of Uganda. The marshalling of the Ugandan tourism industry. Information about a telegram sent by Amin to Chilean General Pinochet wishing him ìPeace, love and  brotherhood.î Amin expressed hope that the situation in Chile would return to normal soon.

description2549=Thesis advisor(s)\: Jenn, David C\n"March 2000."\nThesis (M.S. in Electrical Engineering) Naval Postgraduate School, March 2000\nIncludes bibliographical references (p. 63)\nIn this thesis, a technique involving Stepped Frequency and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) processing have been employed to develop two- dimensional radar images of an aircraft target. Radar returns from prominent scatterers of various parts of the target will be processed and displayed. The processing is a combination of two high-resolution processes\: development of a high-range resolution (HRR) profile in slant range using the stepped frequency waveform, and the development of a high-resolution profile in cross-range using the ISAR technique. With these two techniques complementing each other, images of targets' dominant scatterers can be extracted , processed and displayed. With intelligence databases built over time, precise recognition of target type can be identified\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat reader\nSingapore, Ministry of Defense author (civilian)\ndk/dk cc\:9116 07/06/00\n

description2532=The Straits Settlements were a group of British territories located in Southeast Asia. Originally established in 1826 as part of the territories controlled by the British East India Company, the Straits Settlements came under direct British control as a crown colony on 1 April 1867. The colony was dissolved in 1946 as part of the British reorganization of its south-east Asian dependencies following the end of the Second World War. Some of these territories now form part of Malaysia. This report includes legislative, judicial, law enforcement, financial, education, public works, political, military, agricultural, medical, commerce and miscellaneous general topics. L. F. D’Souza, Printer, Straits Government Press, Singapore, 1867.

description2521=In pharma , the big story of the spring and summer has been M&A. The drama began in April with an asset swap between GSK and Novartis. The most recent headline grabbers have been inversion deals like AbbVie’s $54 billion acquisition of Shire. All this deal activity is a potential threat to innovation. Why? During a deal, it’s easy to overlook the intangible drivers of development\: people and culture. Deal mania makes it easy to forget that people and the way they work together are the main drivers of innovation. Drug development is a team sport, and the way the players interact is a major factor in achieving success. Too often, deals break up environments that have made innovation possible. M&A integrations also create atmospheres of anxiety within a company that dampen R&D productivity. When layoffs occur—or wind of them blows through an organization—people focus less on their jobs and more on job security. The threats to innovation don’t end there\: • R&D budgets shrink, jobs are cut and research projects dry up. • Researchers have to adjust to a new team and a new work environment. • When two distinct research cultures merge, it can destroy delicate ‘ecosystems’ of climate and culture that support scientific discovery. Integration doesn’t have to harm innovation. But you have to stay focused on people. So with our most recent white paper “Keep your innovation from walking out the door” we want to share three key people strategies to keep innovation rolling. Source\: http\://blog.haygroup.com/

description2503=As part of a classroom management module, secondary level student teachers at the National Institute of Education, Singapore, used the Questionnaire on Teacher-Student Interaction to evaluate themselves while they were student-teaching. The questionnaire assessed their interpersonal behaviors and their interactions with classroom students. Behaviors measured included leadership, helpfulness, friendliness, understanding, allowing students responsibility/freedom, uncertainty, dissatisfaction, admonishment, and strictness. Data analysis indicated that the respondents believed they were strict with their students and not very willing to provide students with freedom and responsibility. They wanted to have tight control of their students' learning. The respondents gave themselves high ratings on leadership, friendliness, and understanding and low ratings on uncertainty, dissatisfaction, and admonishing behaviors. Gender influenced their self-evaluations. Male respondents perceived that they displayed more leadership qualities in the classroom and more helping and friendly behavior toward their students than did females, while female respondents perceived that they were more uncertain and admonishing than their male counterparts.

description2502=The role of universities in management education for national development in Southeast Asia was the focus of two workshops held in Singapore. Proceedings of these workshops are categorized according to applications of business management skills and techniques in government and business; desirable attributes of a manager/development administrator; curricula implications in management education for present and future needs; issues and problems in the provision of continuing education for developing management needs; and developing management competence. (MJM)
description2501=This document contains three papers from a symposium on technological change and human resource development. "New Technologies, Cognitive Demands, and the Implications for Learning Theory" (Richard J. Torraco) identifies four specific characteristics of the tasks involved in using new technologies (contingent versus deterministic tasks, distancing technologies, stochastic events, and systemic interdependence) and examines the extent to which the theories of Scribner, Schon, Wenger, and Hutchins are capable of explaining human cognition and learning as they relate to the use of new technologies. "A Study of Technology Transfer for Thai Workers in Thailand" (Palapan Kampan, Boon-Anan Phinaitrup) reports on a study in which a total of 350 human resource managers, Thai workers, foreign workers, and institution administrators were surveyed to gain insight on the process of the transfer of technology from foreign workers to Thai workers in Thailand's manufacturing sector. "Impact of Technological Change on Human Resource Development Practices\: A Study of Singapore-Based Companies" (A. Ahad Osman-Gani, Ronald L. Jacobs) presents a study of 908 randomly selected Singapore-based companies that explored the impact of technological changes on the companies' training and development practices, resistance to technological changes, and sectoral patterns in using training and development strategies to cope with technological change. The first two papers include substantial bibliographies. (MN)

description2499=PIRLS is an international assessment of reading comprehension at the fourth grade that has been conducted every five years since 2001. In 2011, nationally representative samples of students in 49 countries participated in PIRLS and prePIRLS. Forty-five countries assessed fourth grade students, and some countries participated in one or more of the other available options initiated in 2011 to permit wider participation at the end of the primary school cycle\: four countries assessed their sixth grade students; and three countries participated in prePIRLS, a less difficult version of PIRLS inaugurated in 2011 to be a stepping stone to PIRLS. In addition, PIRLS 2011 included nine benchmarking participants, mostly regions of countries that also participated in PIRLS, including three Canadian provinces, two Emirates, the Andalusian region of Spain, and the US state of Florida. Malta and South Africa used benchmarking to collect information relevant to their language of instruction policies. In total, approximately 325,000 students participated in PIRLS 2011, including countries assessing students at more than one grade, benchmarking participants, and prePIRLS. PIRLS 2011 continues the series of significant international studies in reading literacy conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). PIRLS is directed by IEA's TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College. The students in PIRLS responded to questions designed to measure their reading comprehension across two overarching purposes for reading\:?? Reading for literary experience; and Reading to acquire and use information. The achievement results are reported on the PIRLS scale, which has a range of 0-1,000 (although student performance typically ranges between 300 and 700). PIRLS uses the centerpoint of the scale (500) as a point of reference that remains constant from assessment to assessment. The top-performing countries in PIRLS 2011 were Hong Kong SAR, Russian Federation, Finland, and Singapore. In addition to the four top-performers, Northern Ireland, the United States, Denmark, Croatia, and Chinese Taipei had high average achievement, followed by Ireland and England who also performed very well and rounded out the top eleven high-achieving countries. The US state of Florida and the Canadian province of Ontario also did very well. In general, fourth grade students from many countries around the world demonstrated high achievement in reading. Of the 45 countries participating at the fourth grade, only twelve countries had average achievement below the PIRLS scale centerpoint of 500. Countries assessing their sixth grade students also had achievement below 500, as did the prePIRLS countries (estimated via linking to PIRLS). There was evidence, however, that countries with many very low-achieving students at the fourth grade make substantial gains in reading achievement by the sixth grade. The following appendixes are included\: (1) Countries Participating in PIRLS 2011 and in Earlier PIRLS Assessments; (2) Characteristics of the Items in the PIRLS 2011 Assessment; (3) Population Coverage and Sample Participation Rates; (4) Percentage of Students with Achievement Too Low for Estimation; (5) Average Percent Correct in the Reading Purposes and Processes; (6) Percentiles and Standard Deviations of Reading Achievement; (7) Organizations and Individuals Responsible for PIRLS 2011; and (8) Sample Passages, Questions, and Scoring Guides. (Contains 70 exhibits.)

description2496=This article is from BMC Cancer , volume 11 . Abstract Background\: Trastuzumab has revolutionized the way we treat early Her2Neu-positive breast cancer, as it significantly improves disease-free and overall survival. Little is known about the societal costs and benefits of treatment with trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting in Southeast Asia. Methods\: Societal costs (benefits) were estimated as the sum of direct and indirect costs minus benefits in the base case. Direct costs were derived from 4 treatment centers in Singapore (2 private and 2 public, comprising 60-70% of all patients with cancer seen in the island-nation); indirect costs were assessed as the loss of productivity caused by the disease or treatment. Benefits to society were based on extra years of productivity, as measured by GNI per capita, resulting from the quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved with the use of trastuzumab as determined in the models by Kurian, Liberato and Garrison. Results\: Incremental costs in Singapore, in 2005 US dollars, were $26,971.05. Average Cost per QALY was $19,174.59 (Median\: $18,993.70). Costs (benefits) to society ranged from a cost of $79.42 to a benefit of $9,263.06, depending on the model used (Average benefit\: $4,375.89, Median $3,944.03). Sensitivity analysis ranged from a cost of $10,685.00 to a Benefit of US$17,298.79 Conclusions\: Treatment with adjuvant trastuzumab is likely to generate net societal economic benefits in Singapore. Nevertheless, the lower range of possible outcomes does not refute the possibility that treatment may actually generate costs. These costs however clearly fall within the usual range of acceptable cost-effectiveness.

The journal begins as a travel diary of events and observations as Raven sails to his destination. Raven's notes on field collecting are narrative and detailed. He describes the trapping, shooting, and collecting of birds, mammals, reptiles, and perhaps other specimen. Most of the mammals described are small mammals like squirrels, mice, and rats, but Raven also notes a number of monkeys collected. Some examples of locations include Mahakam River, Tenggarong, Samarinda, Tanjung Karangtigau, and Labahankelambu. Many other locations are included\n

description2489=This document consists of three symposia papers on human resources development (HRD) in Asia. "The Impact of Action Learning on the Conflict-Handling Styles of Managers in a Malaysian Firm" (Antony Hii, Michael J. Marquardt) presented results of a quantitative study of a three-month action learning program on managers' conflict-management skills. The statistical analysis showed a significant increase in the desired integrative style of handling conflict in the participating group. "What Is It Like To Be an HRD Practitioner in Taiwan?" (Ya-Hui [Bella] Lien) describes the results of an interpretive study of the "lived experiences" of HRD practitioners. The following three major themes about HRD in Taiwanese work culture were introduced\: (1) HRD is an aspect of human resources management (HRM); (2) HRD is equated with training; and (3) HRD success relies on the vision and support of top management. The final paper, "Role of Public Sector Agencies in National Human Resource Development\: A Study of the Expectations of Singapore-Based Companies" (A. Ahad M. Osman-Gani) describes the importance of strategic HRD in Singapore's transition from an industrial-based to a knowledge-based economy. The study found that involvement from companies in all sectors was crucial for the success of national HRD programs. (The papers contain reference sections.) (CG).

Careful urban planning is needed to ensure that the hydrologic cycle and water quality of the catchment areas are not affected. There are techniques that can attenuate peak flow during rain events and reduce the amount of metals, nutrients, and bacteria that enter the urban water cycle. This brief gives a short introduction on bioretention systems and documents the effectiveness of some 36 plant species in removing water pollutants. A summary on the maintenance requirements is also presented. \n

description2478=This article is from Gut Pathogens , volume 6 . Abstract In Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess (KP-LA), K. pneumoniae K2 is the most frequently isolated serotype after K1, but this serotype has been much less studied. In the present study, the molecular types sequences type (MLST) of serotype K2 isolates from three different regions in Asia were identified and the virulence of these isolates was investigated. Eight different MLSTs were found among 26 isolates (ST 65, 66, 86, 373, 374, 375, 380, and 434). There were two major MLST groups, ST-65-like (42%) and ST86-like (46%). No isolates contained allS while all isolates contained rmpA. The prevalence of aerobactin gene and kfu were 25/26 (96%) and 3/26 (11.5%) respectively. Although liver abscess isolates were generally more resistant (11/15 isolates) to serum killing, there was no specific distribution of serum killing resistant or susceptible ST types between stool carriage and liver abscess isolates. Neutrophil phagocytosis showed that the liver abscess and carriage isolates varied in their susceptibility to phagocytosis. Strains with resistance to both neutrophil phagocytosis and serum killing were generally hypervirulent with lethality at LD50

However, the impact of globalization on schools and universities is not uniform. One public-policy strategy that has been widely adopted is decentralization; but there is no consensus on whether centralization or decentralization is more effective to improve organization and management in education. This book is contextualized in the literature on globalization, and examines how policies of decentralization have affected the running of education in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Shanghai, Singapore, Macau and Mainland China. It analyzes the strategies that the governments of the selected societies have adopted in reforming the structure of education systems, mobilizing different forces to create more educational opportunities, and devising new measures to assure quality in the education sector\n1.

It examines in depth the economic, strategic and political effects of Chinese economic and financial reform. The results of the analysis are further clarified by comparing Shanghai with analogous counterparts in Singapore and Hong Kong. China has developed a number of special and free-trade zones but the new Pilot Shanghai FTZ includes all previous privileges promoting the area as perfect hub for the Asia-Pacific region.

description2426=This article examines the changing nature of the 2-year Diploma in Education program for English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) teachers at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. It describes the evolution of language teacher training from the 1970s through the 1990s and the factors influencing the changing nature of the teacher education curriculum. It focuses on the new, communicative-orientated syllabus and textbooks adopted in 1990 for use in primary school English instruction, and the effect of this new curriculum on the Diploma of Education program. Over the last several years teacher educators have had the difficult task of preparing English teachers for teaching with structural materials during their student teaching while preparing them to teach with new yet unseen communicative materials when they graduated.

description2401=In classifying bilingual education following William F. Mackey's typology, single or dual media or instruction may be used for gradual or abrupt conversion to a wider or narrower culture. Bilingual education in the United States is usually dual medium, either for maintenance or conversion to a wider culture, aiming to produce a bilingual individual or to help assimilate an alien into American culture. The Bilingual Education Act has improved the situation for immigrants and American Indians, who previously were forced into monolingual education. In the Pacific islands, education had focussed on conversion from the native language to the colonial world language. Currently, however bilingual programs exist, and native dictionaries and grammars are being written and orthography reformed. Writing and teaching materials must be developed in the vernacular languages and competent teachers found and trained in order to establish successful dual medium, maintenance bilingual curricula. Schools in Indonesia, Malaysis, the Philippines and Singapore often teach local, national, and world languages. Currently, national languages are assuming ascendancy as colonial languages become foreign tongues. In all three areas of the world, bilingual education is both a source of identity and a factor in social change. (CK)

The report is divided into six major parts, each presenting papers pertinent to the central theme under discussion. Section one deals with policies for teacher education on the regional, national, and international scale. In section two, lifelong and nonformal education are the topics under discussion. Papers deal with broad concepts of the subject, educational demands in changing societies, and nonformal education in developing countries. Curriculum innovations are the topic of the third section. New curriculum content is described, education for peace and achievement motivation are discussed, and a program for the clinical preparation of teachers is examined. Educational technology is the subject in section four. Ways in which a more scientific approach to teacher education can be introduced and how they may be implemented are discussed in the papers presented in this section. Section five is devoted entirely to the subject of inservice education in Asia. Specific activities in eleven Asian countries are described. In the final section, current trends in teacher education are discussed in six geographical regions\: India, Australia, Kenya, Canada, United States, and Southeast Asia. In conclusion a world-wide perspective on teacher education is presented. (JD)

description2392=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 8 . Abstract Objective\: To evaluate the validity and reliability of the Philippines (Tagalog) Short Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2®) standard questionnaire among Filipinos residing in two cities. Study Design and Setting\: The official Philippines (Tagalog) SF-36v2 standard (4-week recall) version was pretested on 30 participants followed by formal and informal cognitive debriefing. To obtain the feedback on translation by bilingual respondents, each SF-36v2 question was stated first in English followed by Tagalog. No revisions to the original questionnaire were needed except that participants thought it was appropriate to incorporate "po" in the instructions to make it more polite. Face-to-face interviews of 562 participants aged 20-50 years living in two barangays (villages) in the highly urbanized city of Makati City (Metro Manila) and in urban and rural barangays in Tanauan City (province of Batangas) were subsequently conducted. Content validity, item level validity, reliability and factor structure of the SF-36v2 (Tagalog) were examined. Results\: Content validity of the SF-36v2 was assessed to be adequate for assessing health status among Filipinos. Item means of Philippines (Tagalog) SF-36v2 were similar with comparable scales in the US English, Singapore (English and Chinese) and Thai SF-36 version 1. Item-scale correlation exceeded 0.4 for all items except the bathing item in PF (correlation\: 0.31). In exploratory factor analysis, the US two-component model was supported. However, in confirmatory factor analysis, the Japanese three-component model fit the Tagalog data better than the US two-component model. Conclusions\: The Philippines (Tagalog) SF-36v2 is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring health status among residents of Makati City (Metro Manila) and Tanauan City (Province of Batangas).

description2391=This article is from BMC Public Health , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: The uptake of HIV testing and counselling services remains low in risk groups around the world. Fear of stigmatisation, discrimination and breach of confidentiality results in low service usage among risk groups. HIV self-testing (HST) is a confidential HIV testing option that enables people to find out their status in the privacy of their homes. We evaluated the acceptability of HST and the benefits and challenges linked to the introduction of HST. Methods\: A literature review was conducted on the acceptability of HST in projects in which HST was offered to study participants. Besides acceptability rates of HST, accuracy rates of self-testing, referral rates of HIV-positive individuals into medical care, disclosure rates and rates of first-time testers were assessed. In addition, the utilisation rate of a telephone hotline for counselling issues and clients` attitudes towards HST were extracted. Results\: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria (HST had been offered effectively to study participants and had been administered by participants themselves) and demonstrated universally high acceptability of HST among study populations. Studies included populations from resource poor settings (Kenya and Malawi) and from high-income countries (USA, Spain and Singapore). The majority of study participants were able to perform HST accurately with no or little support from trained staff. Participants appreciated the confidentiality and privacy but felt that the provision of adequate counselling services was inadequate. Conclusions\: The review demonstrates that HST is an acceptable testing alternative for risk groups and can be performed accurately by the majority of self-testers.

In the era of globalization, multilevel and new modes of governance are changing the traditional governance models of nation states, accelerated by technological innovation, rising citizen expectation, policy intervention from international and multilateral donor communities, and the hegemony of western ideology imposed on many developing nations. However, a universally accepted and agreed upon definition of 'governance’ still remains elusive. There is no consensus or agreement as to what would be the nature and form of governance and public administration. The question that is raised\: Is there a universal governance mechanism that fits in all contexts or governance mechanisms should be based on home grown ideas?One can see various programs and policies of reforms and reorganizations in public administration in the developing countries, but these efforts have not been effective to address the challenging issues of economic development, employment generation, poverty reduction, ensuring equality of access to public services, maintaining fairness and equity, security and safety of citizens, social cohesion, democratic institution building, ensuring broader participation in the decision making process, and improving the quality of life. Therefore, there is a widespread concern for better governance or sound governance to bridge the gap between theory and practice, making this book of interest to academics as well as policy-makers in global public administration\n

description2385=Although this story is written in fairly simple language it is strangely difficult to follow. The setting is that of one man, an old ship's officer, telling another of the same a long story. The language slides between the two men, lighting pipes, making and answering comments, and so forth, and then back into the detail of the story, and sometimes deeper still, into conversations that take place in the story. This has its effect on the use of quotation signs. This is the hardest part of this book to edit. There are rules involving the use of these signs, and most books obey them all the way through, but in this book either the author was being experimental, or the typesetter was a bit confused. Because of the sliding in and out of the depth of the story, the quotes rules often vary from one paragraph to the next. What we have done is to make the quotes rules hold true for each individual paragraph right through the book, and as far as possible we have made the rules consistent from paragraph to paragraph. This is the second time that we have scanned the same copy of this book, and we just hope that we have made a good job of it. Conrad, Joseph, originally Jozef Teodor Konrad Nalecz Korzeniowski (1857-1924) Polish-born British novelist, born in Berdichev, in the Polish Ukraine, now in the USSR. His father was a revolutionary of literary gifts - he translated Victor Hugo’s Les Travailleurs de la mer - who was exiled to Vologda in 1862. In 1878 Joseph joined an English merchant ship and was naturalised in 1884 when he gained his certificate as a master. In the ten years that followed, he sailed between Singapore and Borneo, and this gave him an unrivalled background of mysterious creeks and jungle for the tales to follow. There was also an interlude in the Belgian Congo which provided exotic colour for his Heart of Darkness, one of his three finest short stories, the others being Youth and Typhoon. In 1896 he married and settled at Ashford in Kent, where he lived in seclusion for the rest of his days. Conrad’s first novel was Almayer’s Folly (1894), and then followed An Outcast of the Islands (1896), The Nigger of the Narcissus (1897), Lord Jim (1900), Nostromo (1904), The Secret Agent (1907) and Under Western Eyes (1911) before Chance (1914) made him famous. It was only then that Lord Jim was recognised as a masterpiece. Perhaps the short story was his true medium - Tales of Unrest (1898), Youth (1902) and Twixt Land and Sea (1912). His semi-autobiographical The Mirror and the Sea and his Personal Record testify to his high artistic aims. He also wrote Victory (1919), but his later works, The Arrow of Gold (1919) and The Rescue (1920), owed their popularity largely to his earlier work.

We also provide a plain TEXT version and full instructions for using this to make your own audiobook. To find these click on the PDF, HTML or TXT links on the left. These transcriptions of books by various nineteenth century authors of instructive books for teenagers, were made during the period 1997 to the present day by Athelstane e-Books. Most of the books are concerned with the sea, but in any case all will give a good idea of life in the nineteenth century, and sometimes earlier than that. This of course includes attitudes prevalent at the time, but frowned upon nowadays. We used a Hewlett-Packard scanner, a Plustek OpticBook 3600 scanner or a Nikkon Coolpix 5700 camera to scan the pages. We then made a pdf which we used to assist with editing the OCRed text. To make a text version we used TextBridge Pro 98 or ABBYY Finereader 7 or 8 to produce a first draft of the text, and Athelstane software to find misreads and improve the text. We proof-read the chapters, and then made a CD with the book read aloud by either Fonix ISpeak or TextAloud MP3. The last step enables us to hear and correct most of the errors that may have been missed by the other steps, as well as entertaining us during the work of transcription. The resulting text can be read either here at the Internet Archive or at www.athelstane.co.uk

description2367=Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to test first- and second-order factor models on cognitive abilities and their invariance across male and female samples. Subjects were a stratified random sample of 234 male and 225 female 15-year-old students in Singapore attending Secondary 3 (the equivalent of grade 9). Four first-order factors were found underlying the 23 subtest scores of 2 group intelligence tests, the AH(sub 4) Test of Intelligence and the Advanced Progressive Matrices, and 2 group Piagetian tests, Science Reasoning Tasks and the Arlin Test of Formal Reasoning. Slight differences found in the formal operations, spatial, numerical, and verbal factors of the male and female groups suggest some gender-related differences in these factors. There were two alternative second-order general factor models for the male group, one with three first-order factors and the other with four first-order factors. Only a general factor model with three first-order factors could fit the data of the female sample. This female group model contains some differences in the loading of the formal operations and spatial factors, when compared with that of the male group. Eight tables present study findings.

description2365=Flexibility has become a watchword in modern education, but its implementation is by no means a straightforward matter. Flexible Pedagogy, Flexible Practice sheds light on the often taken-for-granted assumptions that inform daily practice and examines the institutional dynamics that help and hinder efforts towards flexibility. The collection is international in scope, drawing on the experience of specialists in distance education from North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, and Japan. Contributors to the volume were asked to reflect candidly and critically on questions that include\: What precisely is flexible learning? Who or what is driving the flexibility agenda, and for whose benefit? And who or what is resisting it? What challenges must be overcome in order to achieve flexibility, and what are some of the compromises it can entail? In addressing these and other issues, the authors offer a wealth of theoretical insights and a frank assessment of their practical experience. Their report from the trenches will be invaluable to anyone seeking to broaden the reach of higher education. Copyright\: This work is licensed under a Creative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 2.5 CA).

description2332=Sparks Corporation - Stitch had raised over $3 million, and its engineers won a big prize last fall from Salesforce. SugarCRM has quietly acquired (or at least acqui-hired) Stitch, a San Francisco-based “personalized digital assistant” for salespeople, Fortune has learned. Stitch sent word to users late last week that its service was shutting down, although it made no mention of being acquired. It also has not yet updated its website, which still instructs visitors to download Stitch in the iOS app store and Google Chrome web store even though the app is no longer available in either one. No word yet on financial terms. Stitch had raised over $3 million in seed funding from firms like Google Ventures, Foundation Capital, Eniac Ventures, SoftTech VC, Freestyle Capital and SparkLabs Global . Four of its engineers also won the $250,000 grand prize at last fall’s hackathon during Salesforce CRM annual Dreamforce event. Cupertino, Calif.-based SugarCRM has raised over $100 million from firms like DFJ, New Enterprise Associates, Goldman Sachs GS and Walden Venture Capital. A company spokesman has not yet returned a request for comment (not too surprising, given that it’s a Saturday night).

The current follow-up study compares these loading times with the complexity of the Internet routes linking the Web users and the Web servers hosting them. The study was conducted in the same 12 Asian countries, with the assistance of members of the International Development Research Centre's PANdora distance education research network. The data were generated by network members in Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Additional data for the follow-up study were collected in China. Using a "traceroute" routine, the study indicates that webpage loading time is linked to the complexity of the Internet routes between Web users and the host server. It is indicated that distance educators can apply such information in the design of improved online delivery and mirror sites, notably in areas of the developing world which currently lack an effective infrastructure for online education.

description2324=This study analyzes the learning expectations related to grades 1-8 algebra across several U.S. states and high performing TIMSS Asian countries and regions, including Singapore, Taiwan and Japan. In order to narrow and focus the investigation, only one topic within the strand is carefully reported. Based on the official curriculum documents, results of this study indicate that the mathematics content, grade placement and cognitive level of learning expectations related to selected topic vary markedly across documents. Thus, these differences in learning expectations result in striking differences in students' opportunity to learn. (Contains 2 figures and 10 tables.)

description2318="Perceptions of Libraries and Information Resources" (2005) summarizes findings of an international study on information-seeking habits and preferences. With extensive input from hundreds of librarians and OCLC staff, the OCLC Market Research team developed a project and commissioned Harris Interactive Inc. to survey a representative sample of information consumers. In June of 2005, we collected over 3,300 responses from information consumers in Australia, Canada, India, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Perceptions report provides the findings and responses from the online survey in an effort to learn more about\: (1) Library use; (2) Awareness and use of library electronic resources; (3) The Internet search engine, the library and the librarian; (4) Free vs. for-fee information; and (5) The "Library" brand. The findings indicate that information consumers view libraries as places to borrow print books, but they are unaware of the rich electronic content they can access through libraries. Even though information consumers make limited use of these resources, they continue to trust libraries as reliable sources of information. Appended are\: (1) Supporting Data Tables; and (2) Sample Verbatim Comments.
description2317=This paper describes the conceptual and activity focus of a training program for parents and childcare providers to help children develop their learning potential. The program thereby facilitates children's integration into society and enhancement of further learning propensities needed by them to adapt. The focus of the work is to create conditions for the enhancement of learning potential for all individuals, and is directed toward helping parents maximize the developmental interactions that are part of the typical and available life space they experience. It addresses the child with special needs for whom impairments of development caused by a wide variety of conditions require specially designed and implemented interventions to overcome barriers to development. The training model has been presented several times, in a variety of cultures (United States, Singapore, Indonesia); evaluation feedback indicates the efficacy of the model. The model explains that systematic, controlled research has not yet been done. (JDM)

description2315=Confucianism has been identified as the major cultural factor that explains the economic success of the Asian Five Dragons (Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan). This paper explores the impact of Confucianism on the organizational communication in these nations, based on the four key principles of confucian teaching\: the hierarchical relationship, the family system, "Jen" (benevolence), and the emphasis on education. The paper notes that the confucian emphasis on education at all levels has become one of the most important characteristics of Chinese culture, and the tradition is carried over to every Asian nation, especially the Asian Five Dragons. The paper further discusses the influence of these four principles of Confucianism on management behaviors and communication in the organization. The paper also explains the implication of Confucianism's influence on organizational communication. Three tables presenting Confucian principles and their relation to interpersonal communication, management, and organizational communication are included. (Contains 42 references.) (Author/RS)

description2312=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Sediment loads have long been known to be deleterious to corals, but the effects of turbidity and settling particles have not previously been partitioned. This study provides a novel approach using inert silicon carbide powder to partition and quantify the mechanical effects of sediment settling versus reduced light under a chronically high sedimentary regime on two turbid water corals commonly found in Singapore (Galaxea fascicularis and Goniopora somaliensis). Coral fragments were evenly distributed among three treatments\: an open control (30% ambient PAR), a shaded control (15% ambient PAR) and sediment treatment (15% ambient PAR; 26.4 mg cm−2 day−1). The rate of photosynthesis and respiration, and the dark-adapted quantum yield were measured once a week for four weeks. By week four, the photosynthesis to respiration ratio (P/R ratio) and the photosynthetic yield (Fv/Fm) had fallen by 14% and 3–17% respectively in the shaded control, contrasting with corals exposed to sediments whose P/R ratio and yield had declined by 21% and 18–34% respectively. The differences in rates between the shaded control and the sediment treatment were attributed to the mechanical effects of sediment deposition. The physiological response to sediment stress differed between species with G. fascicularis experiencing a greater decline in the net photosynthetic yield (13%) than G. somaliensis (9.5%), but a smaller increase in the respiration rates (G. fascicularis \= 9.9%, G. somaliensis \= 14.2%). These different physiological responses were attributed, in part, to coral morphology and highlighted key physiological processes that drive species distribution along high to low turbidity and depositional gradients.

description2309=This study investigated the effects of investment promotion on investments in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, in Uganda, since the enactment of the Investment Code Act, 1991. It used mostly secondary data and interviews on investments in Uganda. Analysis was qualitative. The findings showed that Uganda Investment Authority has been promoting investments through trade fairs, missions abroad and investment conferences since 1991. A number of opportunities existed in the entire economy, but some priority sectors were targeted. These included Agriculture, ICT, Energy, Health, Education, Mining and Services such as tourism and finance. In terms of countries, UK, USA, Kenya (EAC), South Africa, India, China, UAE and Singapore were targeted as sources of investment into Uganda. Based on the number of firms licensed, the promotion efforts were effective between 1991 and 1995, but since then other factors have determined foreign direct investment into Uganda such as the discovery of oil in the Albertine region and the credit crunch of the 2009. However, there were some inadequacies and failures. The Act excluded foreign investors from participation in agribusinesses which is so critical and which contributes about 40% to the country’s GDP. In the mining sector, despite huge mineral potentials, the Authority neither provided investors with important investments information like geological data and mineral targets that could be used as a basis for attracting serious investors, nor extension services, training and mining equipment. Also, the Government continued to under-fund the targeted sectors such as tourism. To improve the effectiveness of investment promotion, it was recommended that Government should amend the Act to allow foreigners to engage in agricultural businesses; make available important investment information and other services to investors; provide adequate budgetary support for the targeted sectors; improve infrastructure, especially in power and transportation; and tackle the issue of corruption in the country.

description2281=A plasma-assisted concurrent Rf sputtering technique for fabrication of biocompatible, functionally graded CaP-based interlayer on Ti-6Al-4V orthopedic alloy is reported. Each layer in the coating is designed to meet a specific functionality. The adherent to the metal layer features elevated content of Ti and supports excellent ceramic-metal interfacial stability. The middle layer features nanocrystalline structure and mimics natural bone apatites. The technique allows one to reproduce Ca/P ratios intrinsic to major natural calcium phosphates. Surface morphology of the outer, a few to few tens of nanometers thick, layer, has been tailored to fit the requirements for the bio-molecule/protein attachment factors. Various material and surface characterization techniques confirm that the optimal surface morphology of the outer layer is achieved for the process conditions yielding nanocrystalline structure of the middle layer. Preliminary cell culturing tests confirm the link between the tailored nano-scale surface morphology, parameters of the middle nanostructured layer, and overall biocompatibility of the coating.

description2279=This report has a simple aim\: to present results from international assessments so readers can judge for themselves how American students stack up globally. It's intended to be a stand-alone supplement to the "Education Olympics" web event held between August 8th and August 22nd, 2008 (see edolympics.net). It shows how the U.S. has performed internationally in education in recent years, and it provides a glimpse of how education looks in several top-performing nations. The report examines results from four well-known and generally respected international measures\: (1) The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This one covers math and science (like TIMSS), but also evaluates reading literacy and students' ability to apply what they've learned to real-world situations. It's administered to fifteen-year-olds every three years. Data is examined from both the 2003 and 2006 PISA administrations. (2) The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This assessment addresses the knowledge and skills that students have acquired by grade four and eight in math and science. It's administered every four years and we report on the latest year, 2003. [Results from the 2007 administration are not yet available.] (3) The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). This exam covers trends in primary school reading. It's administered every five years and assesses the reading comprehension of students in their fourth year of schooling. Reported is the latest year, 2006. (4) The Civic Education Study (CIVED). This exam is an international assessment of the civic knowledge and skills of 14-year olds (eighth and ninth graders). It also examines student attitudes towards democracy and citizenship and willingness to participate in civic activities. This report examines the results from 1999, the last year it was administered. In addition, two other indicators were examined\: (1) upper secondary (what Americans call high school) graduation ates; and (2) the percentage of a country's college-going population that receives bachelor's degrees (international data on this are from 2004). Drawing from these assessments and indicators, the authors developed 58 events, each focused on student performance on sub-tests or for sub-groups. Each event was an opportunity to win a gold, silver, or bronze medal; there were a few ties, which resulted in a total of 190 medals. The top three "medal winners" across all events are Finland (35 medals), Hong Kong (33), and Singapore (16). The United States wins just one medal\: a gold for its performance on the Civic Education exam. That gives the U.S. a 20th place finish--below Cyprus, Poland, Slovenia, and the Russian Federation, among others. (Contains 31 tables and 10 footnotes.)

description2277=Counseling has emerged in the 20th century as one of three major helping professions, the others being psychology and social work. The United States has had a significant influence on the development of counseling all over the world. An outcome of the International Counseling in the 21 Century Conferences has been the recognition that, regardless of where people train to be counselors, they learn to adapt their training with the cultural realities of their own country. In many respects this is what is happening in America now. Due to the increasing cultural and ethnic diversity, counselors and counselor educators in the U.S. are more aware of the need to incorporate the realities of working in multicultural settings. This book is an outgrowth of the belief that counseling has developed similarly yet distinctly in each country. These papers describe the past, present, and future of counseling in the Pacific Rim countries, such as Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore, as well as Canada and the United States. Papers include\: "History of Counseling in Australia" (Clive Williams); "Counseling in Canada" (E. Anne Marshall and Max R. Uhlemann); "Development of Counseling in Hong Kong" (Betty Lai-ling Lai); and "Counseling in Singapore\: Trends, Issues & Future Directions (Esther Tan). Many papers address school counseling.

description2276=This monograph presents four reports on the care of children with disabilities, resulting from a study/travel project in Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Seychelles, India, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia. The first report focuses on the medical, educational, and social care of children with disabilities. It first summarizes the status of rehabilitation efforts overall and then provides a summary of rehabilitation efforts by individual countries visited. The social circumstances of children and their families are reviewed and major problems identified. The second report focuses on innovative ideas in rehabilitation seen during the trip. These address\: collecting data on disability, changing societal attitudes, personnel development, health care delivery, technical aids, education, vocational training and income generation, family support, and service delivery. Community-based rehabilitation is the focus of many of these innovations. The third report is on pioneering effective solutions in rehabilitation. Topics covered include\: promoting a national network of knowledgeable, skilled organizations; establishing a health care infrastructure; providing affordable technical aids; increasing social acceptance of disability; changing awareness of the potential for improvement; demonstrating a model for integrated education in urban and rural settings; and increasing levels of education. The fourth report looks at societal attitudes and the disability movement, focusing on ways people with disabilities are viewed; ways availability of services has improved; personnel training and professional standards; roles of families, schools, churches, and community organizations; how people with disabilities influence change; response to needs and resources of families; and how disability advocates can help in other countries.

description2275=Noting that current views of mathematical learning and teaching focus on the child as a responsible student who attends to instruction and who constructs what is taught in a personal and meaningful way, this paper examines scaffolding and mediation strategies and describes the learning and teaching of elementary school level mathematics in Singapore. The paper first discusses mathematical knowledge and skill development in young children. The paper then describes elementary mathematics curriculum in Singapore, noting that its central focus is problem solving, and suggesting that teaching mathematics creatively is a challenge for mathematics teachers. The paper also describes the impact of educational policy changes on the school learning climate that have led to increased project work, multiple assessment modes, creative modes of learning, and focus on basic numeracy skills. Next, the paper outlines Vygotsky's views on thinking as a social process, focusing on the strategy of scaffolding and noting that Singapore teachers are highly interactive in the classroom as they try to induce mathematical abilities and skills through social experiences. The paper then describes Feuerstein's mediated learning experience approach, linking differences in learning propensities to an individual's cultural experiences. The paper maintains that many classroom learning problems are the result of insufficient or inadequate mediated learning experience. Finally, the paper describes two examples of mathematical concepts and activities that have inherent opportunities for elaboration and transfer. (Contains 11 references.) (KB)

description2274=Four teachers at a Singapore Catholic elementary school implemented cooperative learning over a period of a year. The teachers received inservice training on cooperative learning and worked closely with a university research team as they implemented cooperative learning for social studies and other subjects. The teachers were subsequently interviewed in the middle and at the end of the project and observed three times in their classrooms. Teachers also maintained a journal regarding their experiences. Four major themes were identified within the four case studies\: (1) the teachers' motivation for adopting cooperative learning in the classroom; (2) the concerns and difficulties faced by teachers; (3) the effects of this innovation on their pupils' learning; and (4) how the use of cooperative learning affected each teacher's own professional development. The findings of the research underscore the need for strong institutional support if teachers are to be motivated to use cooperative learning in a systematic and sustained manner.

Deborah describes the proceedings and excitements of the New England Anti-Slavery Convention at Marlboro Chapel, where a vote was taken for disunion. Deborah said\: "[George] Bradburn was in a quiet way as ugly as Cain." William White "tried to clog the wheels in a good humoured way." The disunion vote was 247 to 23 in favor of it. A speech by Frederick Douglass was interrupted by an insolent stranger. In the evening, Charles C. Burleigh, at the convention, presented a banner to William L. Garrison for the American Anti-Slavery Society. "All the debts of the A[merican] Soc[iety] will be paid next week part of the money borrowed."

description2269=Singapore has attempted to use school-based intervention studies as a vital feedback system in developing a more viable and sensitive preservice curriculum. The Institute of Education (IE), the sole trainer of teachers in Singapore, is conducting ongoing research in the area of effective teaching strategies, which aims at assessing the effectiveness of methods used in fostering learning strategies and metacognitive skills in students of varied background characteristics in English and mathematics studies. Data from two concurrent studies provide information on IE students and secondary pupils' learning strategies and academic ability. A sample is presented of differential learning behaviors of pupils from three different ability streams\: special, express, and normal. Findings from a questionnaire submitted to teachers indicated that the teachers' perceptions of effective strategies did not seem to match their pupils' experiences with the strategies. However, the pupils' ability seemed to influence the teachers' perception of the effectiveness of the learning strategies. Preservice teachers need to know that all pupils, irrespective of ability, should be taught the use of effective learning strategies. A brief description is given of the continuing second phase of this study; four tables displaying the data are appended. (JD)
description2268=High levels of academic achievement in Asian educational systems have generated interest in the study of motivational patterns of students in these contexts. The objectives of this paper are firstly, to provide a review of existing literature on the study of motivational styles amongst students and secondly, to identify the occurrence of different motivational styles amongst students in Singapore,. The method of identifying different motivational styles was adapted from a procedure first developed by Craske (1988). The findings of this study indicate that although the distribution of motivational styles amongst the Singaporean students was consistent with that as obtained by Craske, there was a higher tendency for maladaptive motivation amongst the males than the females. In contrast, Craske found no gender differentiation, though earlier researchers had found that maladaptive motivation was more common among the females. (Contains 3 tables.)
description2267=The information society is a society in which the quality of life, as well as prospects for social change and economic development, increasingly depend on information and its exploitation. In such a society, living standards, patterns of work and leisure, the education system, and the marketplace are all influenced by advances in information and knowledge. The Singapore government is a strong supporter and advocate of Information Technology (IT). One of the three priorities of the government for Singapore's education system in the 21st century is to exploit computer technology for enhancing classroom learning. This paper discusses the negative impact of IT economically, socially, politically, and morally, and the challenges this impact presents to the government. It also discusses the impact on families and how to counsel families of the IT age. Family problems are mostly stress-related; stress is often compounded by advances in technology. Counselors are encouraged to address this issue with families. Clients should learn to be accountable, and adaptable, in learning how to manage stress. (JDM)

description2265=This paper examines the development and success of a pilot teacher training program in Thailand. The 1993-1994 long-distance, English teacher, secondary education pilot program was an inexpensive, effective model that could be used throughout the country and that would benefit teachers who are not able to take advantage of conventional inservice programs. Due to limitations of time, finances, and availability of trainers, language skills and teaching methodology of foreign language teachers in Thailand were difficult to maintain. This summary of the pilot program results identifies the determining factors of success, outlines some of the drawbacks encountered, and concludes with an assessment of the likelihood of sustainability of such a model. The program was developed by a cooperative funding effort between the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Secretariat (SEAMES). The York University English Language Institute (Canada) collaborated with the Singapore-based Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization Regional Language Centre on the design of the program, provision of material writers, and transfer of distance education knowledge and skills to the Thai team. The program initially targeted 45 teachers in 2 areas of the country; 36 successfully completed the course requirements. It is noted that those who completed the course showed significant improvement in teaching skills and knowledge and English language proficiency. (NAV)

description2259=A disturbing gulf between the culture of the United States and that of Singapore, was noted by an American English professor after spending the 1986-87 academic year as a Fullbright lecturer in Singapore's Department of English and Literature and again after returning for the 1991-92 academic year as a visiting professor. Cultural differences were not as disturbing during the first visit as during the second, despite a number of reforms that brought the Singapore English department into closer alignment with the American academic culture. One reason for this change in perspective may be attributed to the instructor's own heightened awareness of the importance of writing in a literature program. In a culture that places emphasis on exam writing rather than process, analytical, or discovery writing, the instructor was frustrated by the attitude students took toward their writing assignments. The situation in the Singapore English curriculum increasingly represented not simply a disagreement over pedagogical methods but the force of what can only be described as culture. Any talk of injecting a composition element into literature courses was met by practical objections to its labor intensiveness. It was also met with something more peculiarly Singaporean\: a defense of the logocentric authoritarianism, which was at the heart of the literature program. The ease of crossing, whether into another person's psyche or into another culture, belies the uncanny tendency of persons and cultures to revert to what they have been, even--perhaps especially--when in the zones of contact. If this seems a gloomy way of regarding cultural differences, it is more genuinely respectful than many of the more optimistic attitudes encountered lately, and one on which an authentic cultural reapproachement might begin to be established.

description2245=Now more than ever, high-quality education for all is a public good that is essential for the good of the public. As the fate of individuals and nations is increasingly interdependent, the quest for access to an equitable, empowering education for all people has become a critical issue for the American nation as a whole. No society can thrive in a technological, knowledge-based economy by depriving large segments of its population of learning. But at a time when three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require postsecondary education, just over one-third of young people receive a college degree. Meanwhile, in many European and Asian nations, more than half of young people are becoming college graduates. Although many U.S. educators and civil rights advocates have fought for higher quality and more equitable education over many years--in battles for desegregation, school finance reform, and equitable treatment of students within schools--progress has been stymied in many states over the last two decades as segregation has worsened, and disparities have grown. These disparities have come to appear inevitable in the United States; however, they are "not" the norm in developed nations around the world, which fund their education systems centrally and equally, with additional resources often going to the schools where students' needs are greater. High-performing countries have created coherent education systems in which all students have equally well-resourced schools, learn the same core content, and benefit from uniformly well-prepared teachers. This article briefly looks at three very different nations--Finland, Singapore, and South Korea--that built strong education systems, nearly from the ground up. (Contains 16 endnotes.)

description2241=Westhill Consulting Travel and Tours , Singapore had arranged many tours on various Wildlife destinations in Asia such as\: Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia is a national park that is home to over 500 species of animals, counting nearly 200 types of mammals. Sumatran tigers and flying lemurs, together with clouded leopards, flying frogs and sambar deer are just some examples of one of the greatest varied animal populations in Indonesia. Gunung Leuser also comprises a rehabilitation house for orangutans. Located in the near-pristine Bukit Barisan Mountains, the park’s altitude shoots from zero to 3,381 meters, with the Alas River cutting the park in half. The Bonin Islands, Japan, also known as the Ogasawara Islands in Japan, have the merit of being the most remote destination on this list; there is no other way to get there but by a 25-hour ferry from Tokyo. It’s completely worth it, however, as visitors have an amazing 90% chance of seeing humpback whales from February-April. Visitors can as well see sperm whales in the summer and fall, and dolphins all year around. The islands are likewise rare in that they were not ever associated to the Japanese mainland or any other continent, and hence are home to crabs, insects and birds not found anywhere else in the world. Danum Valley Conservation Area, Sabah, Malaysia is extended over closely 440 square kilometers in lowland rainforest, Danum Valley was uninhabited by humans when it opened. As soon as you’re in the valley, visitors can take guided walks and drives and nighttime safaris to try and spot the Borneo pygmy elephant, Sumatran rhino, Malay sun bear and more. Throughout durian season, the likelihoods of seeing orangutans upsurge. The real treat here, though, is the birdwatching, as it’s the sole place where the spectacled flowerpecker has only been seen. Similan Islands, Thailand is known as one of the top diving destinations in the world. May it be diving or snorkeling, it’s likely to see spectacular coral reefs, schools of tropical fish, manta rays and sea turtles during the short November-April open season. Mu Ko Similan National Park lets visitors experience the pleasure of seeing air, land and sea-based wildlife, from birds and sixteen species of bats, to vipers, pythons and lizards, too much friendlier bottlenose dolphins. Yala National Park is one of Sri Lanka’s oldest and most famous national parks. It’s most well-known for its huge numbers of elephants and leopards, which can be appreciated when on safari. The park shelters numerous ecosystems, including moist and dry monsoon forests and wetlands. Historical and religious sites and ruins enhance the must-see list. The park is divided into five blocks, making it easier to plan a trip.

description2233=This study examines the prevalence of private commercial schools in Singapore, many of which may not have met the regulatory requirements if strict monitoring actions were to be applied to them. The majority of private commercial schools in Singapore are small and have no proper facilities including libraries, student recreation facilities and computer labs. While over 600 schools have been deregistered since 2009, either voluntarily or involuntarily, following the introduction of the Council for Private Education Act which in 2009, over 300 schools are still operating. Of these 300 schools, only less than one-fifth can be considered to have proper facilities. This first part of this paper explores the possible reasons why some private commercial schools are still in operation despite not meeting the recommended regulatory guidelines. It suggests stricter actions could be taken by the Council for Private Education to ensure that private commercial schools contribute to the improvement of the overall education landscape in Singapore and makes recommendations where the Council for could increase its vigilance on these schools. It also recommends a framework relating to the monitoring and review of the current audit process of private commercial schools. The second part of the paper explores the failure of private commercial schools to deliver quality education to their students and the reasons students are still choosing the private education route as an option for their studies. Contrary to popular assumptions, private commercial schools in Singapore pose no significant competition to public schools. Teachers at private commercial schools had not receive as much training and development as those in public schools. Profit seemed to be the main driver for these

description2230=Axis Capital Group , Singapore is our first company of choice. Our family is into bed and breakfast and when we finally decided to expand to Jakarta Indonesia, since the City is booming on tourism, we immediately contacted Axis. They were actually our partners since day one of the construction of our first business, also bed and breakfast and is located in Southeast Asia as well.   This business has yet to give us our machine next month, they are a bit expensive than others but the quality of their machines are tried and tested, you can trust that they would lease you a quality equipment. I never heard of any customers who had issues and complaints against them.   I also commend their customer service hotline. I usually get pissed on waiting too long just to talk to real people and not the answering machine but theirs is very customer friendly, no waiting time and no rude and no nothing representatives.   I have read some reviews about Axis that I thought were just some part of black propaganda or some unhealthy competition from some envious rivalries. They were unreasonable.   When we paid them the amount that they were supposed to get by June 2000, our first transaction with Axis, one of their front desk assistant promised us that we are going to get our equipment within one week and they did deliver in the promised time and even earlier. We did not have to call them several times just to follow-up on or orders in fact we did not even make any call, nothing at all. When I checked the equipment, all the orders were there and in quality condition despite transported from a far land.   For the past years that we are close deals with them, we never had any complaint at all. This is one company you should never worry about scams or fraud; they are just as genuine as you want your business to be. I recommend them along with my business name.

description2222=Two latest safety occurrences drive home the gravity of disregarding safety hazards. The proprietor and a project manager for U.S. Sino Investment, Fremont, Calif., have been accused on charges of involuntary manslaughter after disregarding a stop-work order. After, an employee died in a trench cave-in. Asphalt Specialties, Pontiac, Mich ., have been instructed to pay almost $1 million for improperly dismissing a foreman and two truck drivers who brought up  concerns about exhausted and fatigued drivers. These acts are accurate and fair. The fired workers are given back pay damage settlements. However the family of the dead worker will never be able to return their dead loved one. Families, friends and others related with those upon whom justice is meted out are correspondingly concerned. The harm to individuals lengthens far yonder those directly concerned in any incident. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reviews job sites, cites dangerous practices, charges fines for same, and commands projects shut down. There have been complaints about the oversight; however incidents like these outshine the troublesomeness. Construction workers or supervisors who disregard unsafe situations need to recognize their accountability for the security of others. If they consider wind speeds endanger safe lifts, tower crane operators have the authorization and responsibility to shut down a project. That’s an extremely noticeable misfortune that is stopped. For trench cave-ins, they are all too usual, and news reports on the accident infrequently travel elsewhere the region in which it happens. Axis Capital Group, Singapore is a company that sells and rents construction capital equipment from cranes to excavators and related heavy construction equipment throughout Southeast Asia such as KL Malaysia, Bangkok Thailand, Jakarta Indonesia and many more has articles, tips and warnings regarding construction safety at http\://axiscapitalgrp.com/ .

description2216=This paper explains how at the institutional level a teacher preparation agency responds to the changes as mandated by the Ministry of Education in Singapore. In particular, it focuses on how the English Language Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) Programme has been responding to the changes to more effectively prepare pre-service trainee-teachers to teach English Language in secondary schools to meet the requirements of the new "English Language Syllabus" (MOE, 2001a). It briefly describes the requirements for entry into the PGDE (Secondary) English Language Programme and the core courses on the programme. Then it reports on how pre-service training is being carried out on various programmes designed to train secondary school teachers, especially, how the "Pupil Experience (PE)" programme is operationalised as an important initiative to induct pre-service trainee-teachers into the English Language teaching profession in Singapore. Implications of such initiatives are also discussed. [This is paper is based on an invited featured symposium at the International Conference on English Language Teaching (ELT) in China (3rd, Beijing, China, May 22-26).]

description2210=Thesis advisor(s)\: Newberry, Conrad F\n"March 2000."\nThesis (M.S. in Aeronautical Engineering) Naval Postgraduate School, March 2000\nIncludes bibliographical references (p. 81-83)\nQuality Functional Deployment (QFD) methodology was applied as a possible system integration tool for use during the conceptual configuration design phase of low speed High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) UAVs. A four-level QFD model was used to identify important design variables and prioritize those that impact customer attributes. The customer attributes were deployed into performance parameters. The performance parameters were deployed into UAV part characteristics. The part characteristics were deployed into manufacturing processes. The manufacturing processes were deployed into process controls. Based on QFD, the research effort showed that to achieve the customer attributes of high endurance, range, cruise altitude and payload, the important performance parameters are low gross weight, low C(D,0), high C(L,max) and a low life cycle cost. The part characteristics considered for the conceptual HALE UAV configuration were maximum utilization of composites, thick airfoil (to increase fuel capacity), high wing fatigue strength and low wing sweep. To achieve the part characteristics, the manufacturing methods considered were autoclaving and filament winding for composites components; milling and precision forging were considered for aluminum alloy components. Manufacturing process controls were also identified. In each QFD matrix, the technical correlations roof provided an effective mechanism for comparing each design parameter against other design parameters in order to determine conflicting design requirements\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat Reader\nRepublic of Singapore Air Force author\ndk/dk cc\:9116 7/14/00\n

description2178=Previously published as\: The feng shui detective goes south\nMr. Wong is a feng shui consultant, but his cases tend to involve a lot more than just interior decoration. You see, Wong specializes in a certain type of problem premises\: crime scenes. He and his brash teenage Aussie-American ex-pat intern (think an Asian Sherlock Holmes paired up with Kelly Osbourne) travel around Singapore solving crimes while trying to decipher each other's language and behavior. His latest case involves a mysterious young woman who, according to a psychic reading, is doomed to die. Wong's desperate efforts to save her eventually lead him and his sidekick to Sydney where the story climaxes at the Opera House, a building known for its appalling feng shui. A delightful combination of crafty plotting, quirky humor, and Asian philosophy, the Feng Shui Detective is an investigator like no other\!\n

description2169=Stitch had raised over $3 million, and its engineers won a big prize last fall from Salesforce. SugarCRM has quietly acquired (or at least acqui-hired) Stitch, a San Francisco-based “personalized digital assistant” for salespeople, Fortune has learned. Stitch sent word to users late last week that its service was shutting down, although it made no mention of being acquired. It also has not yet updated its website, which still instructs visitors to download Stitch in the iOS app store and Google Chrome web store even though the app is no longer available in either one. No word yet on financial terms. Stitch had raised over $3 million in seed funding from firms like Google Ventures, Foundation Capital, Eniac Ventures, SoftTech VC, Freestyle Capital and SparkLabs Global . Four of its engineers also won the $250,000 grand prize at last fall’s hackathon during Salesforce CRM annual Dreamforce event. Cupertino, Calif.-based SugarCRM has raised over $100 million from firms like DFJ, New Enterprise Associates, Goldman Sachs GS and Walden Venture Capital. A company spokesman has not yet returned a request for comment (not too surprising, given that it’s a Saturday night).

description2167=This article is from BMC Genetics , volume 15 . Abstract Background\: India is home to many ethnically and linguistically diverse populations. It is hypothesized that history of invasions by people from Persia and Central Asia, who are referred as Aryans in Hindu Holy Scriptures, had a defining role in shaping the Indian population canvas. A shift in spoken languages from Dravidian languages to Indo-European languages around 1500 B.C. is central to the Aryan Invasion Theory. Here we investigate the genetic differences between two sub-populations of India consisting of\: (1) The Indo-European language speaking Gujarati Indians with genome-wide data from the International HapMap Project; and (2) the Dravidian language speaking Tamil Indians with genome-wide data from the Singapore Genome Variation Project. Results\: We implemented three population genetics measures to identify genomic regions that are significantly differentiated between the two Indian populations originating from the north and south of India. These measures singled out genomic regions with\: (i) SNPs exhibiting significant variation in allele frequencies in the two Indian populations; and (ii) differential signals of positive natural selection as quantified by the integrated haplotype score (iHS) and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH). One of the regions that emerged spans the SLC24A5 gene that has been functionally shown to affect skin pigmentation, with a higher degree of genetic sharing between Gujarati Indians and Europeans. Conclusions\: Our finding points to a gene-flow from Europe to north India that provides an explanation for the lighter skin tones present in North Indians in comparison to South Indians.

description2159=The sixth session of IT@EDU98 consisted of seven papers on the topic of the learning machine--Vietnamese based human-computer interface, and was chaired by Phan Viet Hoang (Informatics College, Singapore). "Knowledge Based Approach for English Vietnamese Machine Translation" (Hoang Kiem, Dinh Dien) presents the knowledge base approach, which consists of concepts such as things, actions, relations, and attributes, organized on the structure of inheritance hierarchy. "A Learning Algorithm for Feature Selection Based on Genetic Approach" (Nguyen Dinh Thuc, Le Hoai Bac) presents a genetic algorithm that chooses relevant features from a set of given features, for feature selection based on the correlation among the features and between every feature and given target curve. "Artificial Neural Network for Color Classification" (Tran Cong Toai) examines several neural network models, their learning schemes, and their effectiveness in color classification. "Synthesizing and Recognizing Vietnamese Speech" (Hoang Kiem, Nguyen Minh Triet, Vo Tuan Kiet, Thai Hung Van, Luu Duc Hien, Bui Tien Len) presents algorithms applied successfully in Vietnamese isolated word recognition and Vietnamese synthesis. "On-Line Character Recognition" (Nguyen Thanh Phuong) presents a real-time handwriting character recognition system based on a structural approach. "Data Mining and Knowledge Acquisition from a Database" (Hoang Kiem, Do Phuc) considers how to use multi-dimensional data model (MDDM) for mining rules in a large database. "Genetic Algorithm for Initiative of Neural Networks" (Nguyen Dinh Thuc, Tan Quang Sang, Le Ha Thanh, Tran Thai Son) describes a procedure for initiative of neural networks based on genetic algorithms, based on the correlation between every weight and error function.

description2158=South-East Asia is a region of vast development diversity but also many commonalities. And the development of higher education in the region, stemmed from its different historical background is changing rapidly towards their respective socio-economic needs. The publication is a joint research study by UNESCO Bangkok and Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) to facilitate and enhance knowledge sharing and learning on higher education in South-East Asia. The research uses case studies from eight countries including Cambodia (Chealy Chet), Indonesia (Nizam), Lao PDR (Khamphone Xay Som Phou), Malaysia (Morshidi Sirat), Philippines (Andrew Gonzalez FSC), Singapore (Jason Tan), Thailand (Varaporn Bovornsiri) and Viet Nam (Ngo Doan Dai) to provide in-depth analysis of their higher education systems. Each case study addresses key issues on higher education including higher education reform; access and diversification; governance and management of higher education institutions; changes in academic profession and academic programs; research capacities; private higher education; internationalization; accreditation and quality assurance; and the challenges for the future. The situation analysis of higher education in South-East Asian countries shows a much diversified picture in individual countries yet at the same time they are faced with similar challenges. It is found that the development of higher education in South-East Asia is tied very closely to political and economic development in individual countries. In the more developed economies, the focuses of higher education are diversification, commercialization, and internationalization. For the less developed economies, there are more diversified needs ranging from access to higher education, funding, training of faculties, and reforms on curricula and governance. For both, massification seems to be the trend ahead yet there are still problems to solve such as balancing the budget, maintaining standards, and the rapidly changing social demands. The joint effort by UNESCO Bangkok and SEAMEO provides an opportunity for analyses of themes and issues relating to higher education in South-East Asia. It also provides valuable lessons to be shared across nations. And there is a general consensus that within the South-East Asian higher education community, closer cooperation is beneficial. Future trends in the development of higher education in South-East Asia will become progressively similar with increasing globalization and mobility. It is believed that there will be more calls for institutional autonomy, financial diversification and quality control, and an ever growing demand for access to higher education. "Higher Education in South-East Asia\: An Overview" (Molly N. N. Lee and Stephen Healy) is also included. Individual case studies contain references. (Contains 50 tables, 8 figures, and 1 diagram.)

description2156=Here are some photos and anecdotes from my one-month ride from Singapore around Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos from 1 February to 3 March, 2014. The bike is a sixteen-year old BMW 1998 R1100R with 157,000 km. This is the tenth time I’ve ridden it into Thailand, and the second time into both Laos and Cambodia. My previous trip in 2012 is reported in “Cambodia, Laos, Thailand – 9900 km, 7 Weeks.” There were 25 riding days, roughly a week in Thailand going north, a week in Cambodia, a week in Laos, and another week in Thailand going south. The average speed on riding days was just 55 km/h including fuel stops, water stops, photo stops, rest breaks, and border crossings. On four riding days in Cambodia and Laos my average speed was less than 37 km/h. Some days the bike hardly came out of first and second gear because the road surface was so poor.

description2152=This exploratory study examined the perceptions of learning held by 259 children in a primary school in Singapore. Their perceptions were compared with those of a sample of 26 teachers and parents. Based on data collected using a rating scale and a metaphor task, various perceptions of learning were identified. Findings indicated that over 70 percent of students had a positive attitude toward learning in schools. More boys than girls agreed that schools gave them valuable knowledge and skills for their futures and that they liked their schoolmates. Girls liked being in school more than boys and more girls liked most of their teachers. All students agreed that they are responsible for their own learning. Parents and teachers were given a metaphor task in which they were asked to select a picture best describing a good learning situation and to write about the picture. Half the adults selected a picture depicting a teacher-centered learning process. Nine adults selected a picture depicting an individual learning process. (KB)

description2138=The foremost tourist attractions are situated in the heart of the city. There are numerous touring trips that arise from here and then advance to the historic waterfront and the Kota district, and lastly weave their way inland headed for the Gambir and Menteng districts. You are guaranteed to leave the country with no complaints at all.   Kota\: The tourist hub of Jakarta and the center of old Batavia, the Kota district. The main action is focused in the historic Taman Fatahillah, a cobbled square that appears to fit to another era. Visit Sunda Kelapa, the old port area, and you can appreciate the schooners recurring from the high seas to trade their exotic spices, an image immortalized in Joseph Conrad reminiscent portrayals. The luminously painted sailing ships are Jakarta’s most unforeseen attractions.   Taman Fatahillah\: This lovely Old Dutch quarter is home to some old and ancient monuments. This is a famous place to view some imposing colonial architecture. The chief fascinations here are the oldest church in Jakarta, the Gereja Sion and Si Jagur, the cannon which represented fertility.   Maritime Museum\: Situated in Sunda Kelapa, this museum which was until the 19th century a warehouse for the Dutch, is currently home to the maritime museum. Model boats and faded sepia photos bring to life the numerous adventures at sea counting the voyage to Jakarta from Europe via Aden. You can take in the spectacular views of the surroundings from the old watchtower.   Puppet Museum\: The museum is a treasure house of puppets from Indonesia and Southeast Asia. You can appreciate an interesting collection of traditional Indonesian puppets like wayang kulit and wayang golek and delight in puppets shows, which are a consistent feature of the museum.   Westhill Consulting Travel and Tours , Singapore\: It was established by a group of people who are travel enthusiasts. They wanted to fulfill a long time dream of travelling the world and they wanted to fulfill others' dream as well.   Taman Mini Indonesia Indah\: This extensive 100-hectare park in Jakarta is an interesting alteration. You can learn Indonesia’s rich cultural heritage. There are pavilions for each of Indonesia’s provinces with shows of regional handicrafts and clothing. There is a big ‘lagoon’ where you can row around the islands of this archipelago or take in a bird’s eye view from the cable cars. As well, there are museums, theatres, restaurants and a bird park with a walk-in aviary. Inquire the people of Jakarta and they will tell you that if you visit the park then there is no need for you to go to any other part of the country. For them the park ‘is whole of Indonesia under one roof.’ You can walk, drive your own car, or take a free shuttle to go around the park just be careful with scams.   National Museum\: No hoax but this is reflected to be the Jakarta’s most striking museum; the National Museum offers interesting insights into the history of the city and Indonesia. Exhibits here consist of early Chinese ceramics, pieces culled from Java’s myriad temples and a bronze elephant that was gifted to the museum by the King of Thailand.        
description2137=We thoroughly analyse the novel quantum key distribution protocol introduced recently in quant-ph/0412075, which is based on minimal qubit tomography. We examine the efficiency of the protocol for a whole range of noise parameters and present a general analysis of incoherent eavesdropping attacks with arbitrarily many steps in the iterative key generation process. The comparison with the tomographic 6-state protocol shows that our protocol has a higher efficiency (up to 20%) and ensures the security of the established key even for noise parameters far beyond the 6-state protocol's noise threshold.

description2122=This study investigates the nature of concerns and attitudes held by pre-service teachers regarding inclusive education and their degree of comfort on interaction with people with disabilities. Pre-service training may be the optimal time to address educators' concerns and alter any negative attitudes about inclusive education. This paper reports the perceptions of pre-service teachers prior to their involvement in units of work focusing specifically on inclusive education in universities located in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Results indicate significant differences exist between the students in the eastern countries of Singapore and Hong Kong, and those in the western countries of Canada and Australia. Participants in the Western countries tended to have more positive sentiments and attitudes towards students with disabilities, and more concerns than their Eastern counterparts. The study also suggests that in most instances pre-service teachers have more positive attitudes towards people with disabilities and inclusion, and more confidence in implementing inclusive practice when they have had additional training and/or experience with people with disabilities.

description2108=This article is from Globalization and Health , volume 9 . Abstract Trade poses risks and opportunities to public health nutrition. This paper discusses the potential food-related public health risks of a radical new kind of trade agreement\: the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP). Under negotiation since 2010, the TPP involves Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the USA, and Vietnam. Here, we review the international evidence on the relationships between trade agreements and diet-related health and, where available, documents and leaked text from the TPP negotiations. Similar to other recent bilateral or regional trade agreements, we find that the TPP would propose tariffs reductions, foreign investment liberalisation and intellectual property protection that extend beyond provisions in the multilateral World Trade Organization agreements. The TPP is also likely to include strong investor protections, introducing major changes to domestic regulatory regimes to enable greater industry involvement in policy making and new avenues for appeal. Transnational food corporations would be able to sue governments if they try to introduce health policies that food companies claim violate their privileges in the TPP; even the potential threat of litigation could greatly curb governments’ ability to protect public health. Hence, we find that the TPP, emblematic of a new generation of 21st century trade policy, could potentially yield greater risks to health than prior trade agreements. Because the text of the TPP is secret until the countries involved commit to the agreement, it is essential for public health concerns to be articulated during the negotiation process. Unless the potential health consequences of each part of the text are fully examined and taken into account, and binding language is incorporated in the TPP to safeguard regulatory policy space for health, the TPP could be detrimental to public health nutrition. Health advocates and health-related policymakers must be proactive in their engagement with the trade negotiations.

description2101=An editorial by Kit Grauer introduces this collection of articles which establish that there is no such thing as a simple definition of art education even within one culture, and that people's views can be reflected by art educators across the world. The first article, "A Window on Three Singapore Art Classrooms" (Jane Chia; John Matthews; Paul O'Shea), provides a view of art education in a nursery school, a primary classroom, and a special Art Elective Program at the secondary level in Singapore. The plight of art as a second class subject at the elementary level and the problems and difficulties of the educators echo a common familiarity. "A Classroom in OZ" (Chris Parmenter), looks at art in two secondary classrooms in Australia. "A Look Over the Diversity" (Mirian Celeste Martins), describes the use of three philosophical and pedagogical orientations at work in Brazilian elementary art classrooms. Other articles discuss\: "A Personal Window into an Art Class in Budapest" (Istvan Bodoczky); "'A Funny Jungle Gym'\: In the Front Line of Japan's New Policy for Individualization" (Toshio Naoe); "American Arts Education in Elementary Schools\: Craft, Child Art, and Fine Art" (Liora Bresler); and "A Day in the Life of an Elementary Art Specialist in Rural Midwestern America" (Leah H. Morgan). The articles are followed by reports and news from the International Society for Education Through Art (INSEA) members of various world regions. (MM)

description997=Eine Politik könnte als eine Gruppe Vorgehen --etwas darstellen, der Fortschritte im Laufe der Zeit und schließlich durch neuere Beteiligten angenommen wird. Es ist ein klarer Ausdruck eines Unternehmens Stellung zu bestimmten Themen und führt ihren Stakeholdern wie seine Ziele zu erreichen. Zweifellos ist es ein muss für jedes Unternehmen , denn sie als ein Muster oder eine Norm, die beteiligten beraten werden dient, wenn es einen Streit über die Durchführung einer bestimmten Entscheidung. Allerdings ist die Entwicklung einer Politik eines langen und mühsamen Prozesses. Der Keeley Consulting Group beschreibt den Prozess der politischen Entwicklung als etwas, das nicht nur auf kollektive Entscheidung des Unternehmens, in welche Richtung zu nehmen, sondern auch auf die einzelnen Ansichten der Stakeholder basiert. Will man um das Wesen der Entwicklung einer leicht zu verstehen, ist hier ein Überblick über die Grundlagen\: -Bestimmen Sie den Zweck, den eine bestimmten Richtlinie in der Organisation dienen wird. -Delegieren Sie ein Team auf die Entwicklung der Politik vorantreiben zu konzentrieren. Der Entwicklungsprozess dauert mehrere Monate bis Ende, so dass es einen Plan detailliert, wer die erforderlichen Aufgaben und den entsprechenden Zeitrahmen für jede tun soll. -Abgesehen von der offensichtlichen Notwendigkeit für Rechtsbeistand in dieser Forschungsphase erfordert auch offizielle Berichte der Organisation und Grundsatzpapieren geltender Rechtsvorschriften zu verwandten Themen lesen. Weitere Informationen kann von einem Treffen mit Experten oder eine Umfrage unter den Interessenten gesammelt werden. -Bereiten Sie ein Diskussionspapier, enthält eine Übersicht über alle Informationen, die aus der Forschungsphase gesammelt sowie einige Politik-Vorschläge, die daraus abgeleitete vor. -Ein Beratungsgespräch mit den Beteiligten muss durchgeführt werden, um ihr Feedback auf das Diskussionspapier zu erhalten. Es ist zwingend notwendig, dass alle interessierte Parteien in dieser Phase einbezogen werden, um eine vernünftige Politik zu schaffen. -Nachdem die Akteure ihre Ansichten gegeben haben, kann ein Entwurf jetzt basierend auf die Anhörung vorbereitet. -Die aktualisierten Entwurf-Politik muss weitere Diskussion und Revisionen unterzogen, so ist es entscheidend, die Stakeholder Feedback wieder zu bekommen. Keine Erläuterungen oder semantischen Bedenken sollten an dieser Stelle behandelt werden. -Sobald die Arbeitsgruppe festgestellt, dass alle Bedenken in Bezug auf die Politik zufrieden stellend gerichtet worden, kann es nun abgeschlossen werden. Die endgültige Politik muss dann formell von der Gruppe in einer Sitzung angenommen werden. Auch sollten für die Phase der Annahme arbeiten die Politik effektiv kommuniziert werden konzernweit, sicherstellen, dass jeder Beteiligte nur gut informierte der Umsetzung. -Selbst, wenn es bereits implementiert wurde, konnte eine Politik noch verfeinert und überarbeitet werden muß. Ein fester Zeitrahmen sollte festgelegt werden, um seine Wirksamkeit zu bewerten (z.B. alle 6 Monate, jährlich, etc.).

This implementation on a networked virtual environment might be limited and could affect the overall system performance. The performance of HLA on PC workstations in a networked virtual environment might not be determined, and therefore the effects and limitations of its implementation could severely hamper the realism of real-time virtual environments. The goal of this thesis is to determine me limitations of the High Level Architecture (HLA) in a networked virtual environment on the Windows NT platform. In identifying the limitations of HLA, we will be able to ascertain the areas in which HLA can be improved. This thesis implements and measures the system performance of three different setups, namely a standalone virtual environment, a networked virtual environment using HLA, and a networked virtual environment using User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The system performance measured includes average CPU, network, graphics and memory processing requirements, frame rate per second, and the reliability of data received. The results indicate the use of heavily threaded processes by HLA significantly reduces overall system performance\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat reader\nSingapore Ministry of Defense author (civilian)\ndk/dk cc\:9116 06/30/00\n

description992=This paper reports an intervention study on Singapore primary five (fifth Grade) students' ICT (information and communication technology)-mediated Chinese idiom learning. We introduced "seamless learning" to the learning design, that is, the bridging of formal and informal learning, and individual and social learning, conforming to the current trend of language learning which emphasizes more on communicative and authentic learning activities. Our study lasted for ten months. In the formal learning context, the teacher conducted in-class contextualized learning activities and group activities. In the informal learning context, students made sentences by using the idioms to describe their encounters in day-to-day life and post them onto a class wiki space for sharing peers' review. Meanwhile, students learned from and performed peers' views on the wiki by commenting on, correcting or improving their peers' sentences. Through our analysis on the empirical data, it was found that the new ICT-mediated learning could effectively help students synergize the formal and informal, as well as the individual and social language learning spaces.

description991=Anyone who has the perseverance and determination to start a business can be an entrepreneur. This is what Axis Capital Group Business Funding , a credit source offering loans to small businesses and startup in the United States and is now servicing Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia believes in.  In their book, Start Your Own Business, the staff of Entrepreneur Media, Inc. guides you through the critical steps to starting a business, then supports you in surviving the first three years as a business owner. In this edited excerpt, the authors offer some tips to help you determine if being a business owner is a smart move for you. To fully understand the scope and limitations you have, you have to first accept both of your strengths and weaknesses.  It can be possible that a person possesses all the qualities needed to be successful but it is very rare for these cases to occur. You need to evaluate the major achievements in your personal and professional life and skills to accomplish them. The following may help you determine your potential\: 1. Create a Personal Resume List all your experiences and expertise. Review them and for each experience, describe the duties you were responsible for and the degree of your success. Include professional skills, educational background, hobbies, and accomplishments that required expertise or special knowledge. When it's complete, this resume will give you a better idea of the kind of business that best suits your interests and experience. 2. Analyze your personal attributes No one knows who you are better than you do. Are you open-minded? Are you friendly? Are you well-organized? Evaluating your personal attributes reveals your likes and dislikes as well as strengths and weaknesses. If you don’t feel comfortable around other people, then a business that requires a lot of customer interaction might not be right for you. Or you may want to hire a “people person” to handle customer service. 3. Analyze your professional attributes Some business owners are jack-of-all-trades, master of none. You do not have to be expert of all industries; you can just focus on one. Just be aware of the areas where you’re competent and the areas where you need help, such as sales, marketing, advertising and administration. Next to each function, record your competency level—excellent, good, fair, or poor. Define your Goals What is your goal? How can you best approach it using all the strengths and weakness you have or the capabilities you see you can offer? Almost all business owners and start-ups, even scams and fraudulent ones, dream of expanding and growing their business. What can you do in putting yours in the edge? For some people, the goal is the freedom to do what they want when they want, without anyone telling them otherwise. For others, the goal is financial security.

description990=This article is from BMC Infectious Diseases , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: Drug resistant organisms pose an increasing threat to the successful treatment of common infections. Understanding colonization patterns of these bacteria is important for effective antibiotic treatment and infection control guidelines. Methods\: A prospective observational study was performed to determine the prevalence of colonization with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) among patients admitted via the emergency department to a public tertiary hospital in Singapore. Anterior nares, groin, axillary and rectal swabs were collected at admission and cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. Clinical data including healthcare contact within the past 12 months and recent antibiotic use was collected and analyzed using a logistic regression model. Results\: 1006 patients were screened. 124 (12.4%) were colonized by ESBL-E, 18 (1.8%) by MRSA while no VRE was detected. Antibiotic use within the past month was the only significant predictor for ESBL-E colonization in the regression model, with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 2.58 (1.04 to 6.42). In participants recently prescribed antibiotics and hospitalized in the previous 3 months, 29.4% were colonized by ESBL-E. This represented 20.2% of the total ESBL-E burden, and ESBL-E was also detected in 6.3% of participants with no healthcare contact. Hospitalization and outpatient hospital visits predicted MRSA colonization in the univariate analysis. Neither was statistically significant in the logistic regression model, with AORs for MRSA colonization following hospitalization in the past 3 and 12 months of 3.81 [95% CI 0.84-17.28] and 3.48 [0.64-18.92] respectively. Conclusion\: A high prevalence of colonization with ESBL-E was evident among patients at admission, even in the absence of recent antibiotic use or contact with healthcare.

description986=This paper examines the impact of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) on transnational higher education in four countries\: New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Malaysia. The GATS is a multilateral agreement through which WTO members commit to voluntary liberalisation of trade in services, including education. Transnational (or offshore) education refers to education that is delivered by an institution based in one country to students located in a different country. Two of the countries considered, New Zealand and Australia, have made commitments under GATS to allow relatively unrestricted cross-border provision of education in their countries, while the other two countries, Singapore and Malaysia, have made no such commitment. There is currently considerable activity in renegotiating countries' commitments to GATS as part of the Doha round of WTO negotiations, and simultaneously bilateral free trade agreements are being proposed between countries in the region. In this context, this paper examines the practical impact that GATS has had on these two countries that have made commitments regarding education, and the likely impact that similar commitments by Malaysia and Singapore would have on the tertiary education systems in those major importing countries.

Kok-Wah Lee @ Xpree Li the author cum inventor proposes six major/minor novel components\: (i) A derived method from Hirsch index to interpolate or extrapolate to get finer H-index between two peaks, so as to show quantity of oneâs useful or valuable research outputs, among close competitors. (ii) A new method after considering the risks of human lifetime and interaction to estimate the (user) count index from the first two topmost peaks, so as to show quality of oneâs useful or valuable research outputs. (iii) A new method combining the finer H-index (x) in Claim 1 and (user) count index (y) in Claim 2 to form Lee claim index in 2D form. (iv) A derived method from Claim 3 so as to get data from many researchers in various fields to plot a 2D graph for comparisons within or among career field(s). (v) A new method to figure out the resources optimization of human brain, time, and space, so as to form a dominant subject group as a headquarter (HQ) from topmost peaks to lead other lagging peaks or groups. (vi) An enablement model as a simplest case for Claim 5 to acclaim a dragon-like group has 5 peaks.

description975=Ofte ser vi selskaper som har fått stor suksess hevder at deres prestasjoner var på grunn av deres profesjonelle lag av arbeidere som flittig anvende sin kompetanse på en konsekvent måte i mange år. Og dette er nesten alltid tilfelle, og det kan bli opprettet som det underliggende faktum i alle tilfeller. Likevel, hvis vi kommer til å tenke på det, profesjonalitet kan lært og vunnet gjennom år med trening og inculcation av de beste mentorene med de beste prinsipper og instrumenter av utdanning uten personen selv helt akseptere ultimate motivet for hele prosessen. Hva mener vi med det? Vurdere soldaten som går gjennom boot camp. Alle hard trening og disiplin like leveres til denne soldaten også om hver andre soldat i en hel hær. Vi ender opp med en godt organisert og godt trente hær, komplett med de nyeste våpen tilgjengelig. Men likevel, som forsikrer ikke hæren at det vil vinne alle kampene det vil delta i. En mer overlegen hær, ikke bare i antall men ytelse under spesielle omstendigheter kan få seier på grunn av generelle forståelse av faktorene som gjør for en seirende overgrep mot en fiende kraft. Enkelt saker, en hær eller en bedrift selskap. Men er hva betyr mer måten de enkelte delene er administrert og kontrollert for å oppnå felles mål for hele gruppen, ikke bare for enkelt. En soldat kunne skyte så mange fiender. men hvis fienden ender opp med å få mer grunn som et resultat, den enkelte score spiller ingen rolle. Du har den høyeste skytespillet i basketball teamet, og likevel miste spillet. Profesjonalitet eller effektivitet er ikke bare i ytre utførelsen av sine oppgaver, men i hjertet. Det er en intern kvalitet som gjennomsyrer hele organisasjonen og gjør hele organisasjonen å oppføre seg som en organisme som det var ment å fungere. Bee kolonien er det beste eksempelet kan vi presentere. Hver bee er perfekt bærer av koloniens kultur. Det opprettholder optimal virkningsgrad jakt og høste honning. Hver bee ikke bare har evnen til å lukte ut nektar-tunge blomster, den har også kompetanse til å hjelpe andre bier å unngå ineffektive trekk. Vi vet nå at en bie, etter høsting nektar fra en bestemt blomst, markerer som blomster som allerede tom gjennom en duft det blader, advarer andre å omkjøringsvei det. Sann profesjonalitet, derfor tillater arbeidstakere å lukte ut de beste klientene og å fortelle andre at dårlig klienter er rundt og må unngås. Det går også mulig dårlige avgjørelser eller dårlig investeringsvalg som kan oppstå underveis. Slike ferdigheter kan skaffes gjennom trening, må vi innrømme. Men det tar ekstra lidenskap, ikke bare opplæring, for å utvikle kapasitetsnivået som tillater folk å overvinne større utfordringer og godta mer intense risiko for å oppnå høyere mål ikke vanligvis tatt av andre. Det er ekstra kant i nyskapende og entreprenør makt som bestemmer best fra gode. Ekte profesjonalitet er hjertet, ikke bare av sinnet. Forstå hvordan hjertet fungerer og du få som kant over dem som bare lærer. hvorfor? Fordi hjertet krever dypere omsorg og større fantasi, ikke bare bare kunnskap og rutine. Aztec forstår veien til en vellykket organisasjon. Folk rolle og de trenger å bli anerkjent og belønnet tilsvarende. Men for de som er virkelig profesjonelt på hjertet, erstatningen kommer før belønningen. Utfordringen av arbeidet gjør av arbeidet og fullføringen av arbeidet er en og samme. Som jeger som lukter og hører drepe før den blir sett, kommer eventyr og gleden over å gjøre noe med gjør seg. Alle som gjør sitt beste er belønnet med å ha gjort hva som må gjøres og selve materialet gevinster ervervet. Men hjertet som allerede vet på forhånd utfallet er på fred og innhold før den faktiske gjør. Det er ekte og ekstraordinære profesjonalitet.

description967=This article is from Brazilian Journal of Microbiology , volume 43 . Abstract Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is a global concern nowadays. Due to its multi-drug resistant nature, treatment with conventional antibiotics does not assure desired clinical outcomes. Therefore, there is a need to find new compounds and/or alternative methods to get arsenal against the pathogen. Combination therapies using conventional antibiotics and phytochemicals fulfill both requirements. In this study, the efficacy of different phytochemicals in combination with selected antibiotics was tested against 12 strains of S. aureus (ATCC MRSA 43300, ATCC methicillin sensitive S. aureus or MSSA 29213 and 10 MRSA clinical strains collected from National University Hospital, Singapore). Out of the six phytochemicals used, tannic acid was synergistic with fusidic acid, minocycline, cefotaxime and rifampicin against most of strains tested and additive with ofloxacin and vancomycin. Quercetin showed synergism with minocycline, fusidic acid and rifampicin against most of the strains. Gallic acid ethyl ester showed additivity against all strains in combination with all antibiotics under investigation except with vancomycin where it showed indifference effect. Eugenol, menthone and caffeic acid showed indifference results against all strains in combination with all antibiotics. Interestingly, no antagonism was observed within these interactions. Based on the fractional inhibitory concentration indices, synergistic pairs were further examined by time-kill assays to confirm the accuracy and killing rate of the combinations over time. The two methods concurred with each other with 92% accuracy and the combinatory pairs were effective throughout the 24 hours of assay. The study suggests a possible incorporation of effective phytochemicals in combination therapies for MRSA infections.

description966=The complexity of nanostructured materials presents challenging difficulties in characterization using conventional techniques. For example, conventional x-ray diffraction may not provide accurate information on the structure (solid solution or phase separation) of nanostructured materials. Complementary advanced characterization methods are often required in the detailed understanding of structures. In this paper we report our work on characterization of two nanostructured systems, namely, AgNi powder and NiCo films, using synchrotron radiation techniques of x-ray diffraction, anomalous x-ray scattering and x-ray absorption spectroscopy.

description965=We all recognize the necessity of insurance in present times. With thousands and even millions of people losing their properties and even lives in natural disasters, the loss could have been worse if not for the assistance of insurance. Across the globe, life, health and car insurances are prevailing. Indeed, insurances have undergone great changes in both developed and developing nations. The changes in the market showed the gradual move towards liberalization and privatization and also the consolidation of insurance operations. The last 5 years had shown eventful development of insurance market. Not only in America and Europe was there a great change. Even developing cities of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Jakarta, Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand has revamped their own systems to make way for further growth Singapore, Japan, Seoul, South Korea and China, on the other hand, are known to have distinct insurance characteristics. Some of the changes that insurance underwent to are\: 1. Adaption of Technology Technological usage has benefited insurance in terms of cost and ease of usage. Services have become more efficient and products are easily distributed. However, the products sold online limits to be personal insurances as the internet is still an easy venue for scammers and hackers. Larger insurance coverage, such as commercial insurance continues to rely on agents and brokers for advisory inputs. 2. Fragmentation of specific function Insurance companies have become more detailed. The task has been distributed into underwritings, administration and fund management and other different functions provided by different entities. This disaggregation could be useful for developing countries, which could then invest in capturing specific markets such as policies administration, marketing, claim settlement/processing and fund management, accounting and underwriting. 3. Strengthening of ties between the bank and insurers Banks and insurers have joined forces over the years through conglomerates (broader financial spectrum) and bancasurrance (fuse between bank and insurance) Insurers have diversified into banking and asset management products. Moreover, new services and products are also offered.Insurance also have secured risk management program for the benefits of clients. 4. Ease of Access through off-shore sites Gone were the times when insurance have been imprisoned within the boundaries of its localities. International connection has been developed to cater to the demands of those abroad. Axis Capital Inc., one of the leading insurance companies in Bermuda, is itself an example with off-shore sites in as far as Singapore, Australia and Europe. More than 10 branches more are scattered around the United States.

Several interrelated “fault lines” usually indicate that the ground beneath a company is unstable. These fault lines focus on several key fundamentals questions\: whether the business serves the right customers, uses the right performance metrics, is properly positioned in its industry and deploys the right business model. Fault lines 1.Is business model aimed at right customers? For most of 160 years, Aetna serviced mainly large corporations, government, universities and other employers. “Typically, one person or small department chose health plans for entire organization” Aetna’s core competency was selling to intermediaries rather than end consumers. Because managers and brokers were always trying to demonstrate value to their organizations, the business came to mean always offering something “new”. Few members used the new features in a given year but paid higher and higher premiums. These one-size fits all plans satisfied primary customers’ needs (benefits managers) but not the true end customers. Switching to B2C emphasis\: Aetna immediately began develop new products and services directly targeted at end-user needs and began helping consumers make informed decision about health. The business model’s primary purpose was to develop the right health plan for situations and hospitals, clinics and providers and most of all provide higher quality lower-cost cares. Questions asked\: 1.What are each group’s unmet needs? Do they vary across different customer types? 2.Can new competitors seized opportunities from potential customers we are servicing? 3.Are customers loyal to our product or captive because of lack of options and would they defect if they could? 4.If we are a B2B company, do business customers’ needs conflict with those of end consumers? 5.Could emerging technologies simply change how end users’ needs are met? 2.Performance metrics When industries reach inflection points old metrics are often deceptive and sometimes dangerous. Once reliable measurements, may often lead to sharp declines or even failures, even though short term results may be healthy. For instance, health benefits managers may want the largest physician and hospital networks possible within a cost range and minimum complaints. Aetna began measuring three factors that were most valuable to future customers\: 1.Improving care experience 2.Improving populations’ health 3.Reducing costs New focus\: Aetna’s old business model focused on acquiring new customers, building the customer base and lower risk exposures. After considering the following questions, its new model focused on retaining existing customers. 1.Do we understand what our customers really value? How well does our production performance or service match customers definitions of value? 2.Will customer of tomorrow define quality differently from today’s customers? 3.How closely do customer satisfaction and financial metrics correlate? Are customers’ satisfaction scores as strong as our financial indicators? 4.Are we measuring units and volumes rather than outcomes? If outcomes, are we measuring ones that matter to customers, or ones that matter to us? 5.Do our products or services have more features or complexity than most or our customers’ value? 6.Is there a new metric that aligns with the needs of future customers?

description962=This paper shares a cognitive intervention approach to teaching thinking to first-year students in engineering and applied science courses in Singapore. The theoretical underpinnings of the Cognitive Modification Intervention (CMI) are based on Feuerstein's Theory of Structural Cognitive Modifiability. Embedded in this theory is the Theory of Mediated Learning Experience, which propounds that the quality of interaction between a learner and an intentional human play a significant role in the cognitive development of the learner. The design of the intervention includes a diagnostic approach for attacking cognitive deficiencies through self-awareness and metacognitive activities; cognitive modification through mediation learning; and bridging and use of thinking tools for effective transfer across academic and life situations. The study used four experimental and four control groups, with 18-20 students per group who participated in the intervention. Although the quantitative results of the pre- and posttests are not yet fully analyzed, the subjective experience of the mediator and qualitative feedback from the participants are encouraging. The results lend support to the school of thought that thinking can be taught and that intelligence is modifiable. (SM)

description955=In 2012, bevacizumab, a drug which is currently used to cure tumor has been reviewed to have components of chalk. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) immediately sent out warnings to hospitals and clinics of possible the possible taint. It was then found out that for many years, doctors has been prescribing the drug which contains either chalk or cornstarch. In Jakarta, Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand, FDA even found out that there are a number of bevacizumab which has no effective ingredient at all. Three years had passed and there is no exact improvement in fighting off the widespread of counterfeit medicines. The Peterson Group, a non-profit organization campaigning against the proliferation of counterfeit medicines returned to Jakarta to review the status of medicine industry in the city. Although the hospitals and clinics have been more cautious of the supply of medicines coming in and out of their facilities, there are still instances which they cannot assure the distribution of these fraudulent medicines in drug stores and markets. The control may not already be in their hands but on the legal action taken by the manufacturers themselves. Pfizer, Sanofi and other large companies are doing their own investigations on the deadly medicines. They reason out that other mediocre manufacturers may not have the proper tools to tag their own products let alone make their own move against counterfeiting. Technologies which have the capability to trace, scan and analyze a product are still costly which a lot of manufactures cannot procure. The end result may lead to total foreclosure because of the fall of business.  Large companies are lucky enough to have the means for a total and more focused analysis on the competitive counterfeit products. However, they face a different dilemma and conflict with the local government they are working with. The investigations may not be totally transparent since the public power itself has strict political agenda that may hinder the cause.  The following are the key factors that make the campaign against counterfeiting incongruous with the authorities\: 1. Inadequate Legislation and enforcement Albeit the pure cause and the high probability of crime, some nations have lax security system and inadequate, sometimes vague legislations regarding counterfeiting. Counterfeiters may sometimes have a low risk of punishment 2. Insufficient Penal Sanctions Despite the best efforts of manufacturers to take into custody, perhaps put in life imprisonment, those who are involved in these fraudulent acts, the penalty system for counterfeiting may be too sloppy to be feared.  3. Lack of awareness among health professionals and consumers Civilians and other individuals may not have any tools or proper education system to detect and determine counterfeited medicines.

description954=This document is a summary of the situations of six Asian nations (The People's Republic of China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and India) compared to the United States in science and technology education. The paper includes a table of the production of bachelor of science degrees in science and engineering in 1990, comparing the Asian countries as a group with the United States. Graphs of human resources discuss growth in enrollment in higher education, ratio of university enrollments to college age population, and higher education degree data. Degree information is broken down into degrees in the natural sciences and engineering. A chart shows the number and percentage of Asian students from each of the countries in question who study natural sciences or engineering at U.S. universities at the doctoral and bachelor levels. The ratio of science and engineering degrees to total degrees is represented. Expenditures for research and development are compared between the Asian countries and the United States, as are science and engineering personnel. Growth rate in gross domestic product is represented. After the general comparisons, each of the six Asian nations is discussed individually. Implications for the United States include the continuation of Asian countries' use of the U.S. higher education system. Foreign graduate student enrollment in U.S. universities and preference for natural science and engineering degrees will maintain U.S. doctoral program's strong emphasis on natural science and engineering. These nations will challenge the United States, for the personnel educated in U.S. universities for their own high technology economies. (DK)

description953=A study investigated patterns in plural marking in the English spoken in Hong Kong, largely as a second language. It focused on the effect of three types of prenominal morphemes\: (1) those that are neutral with respect to plurality (e.g., "other, certain"); (2) modifiers indicating the noun should be marked for plural (e.g., "one of the, all, fewer"); and (3) the modifiers "some, any." The results suggest that the Hong Kong English speaker tends to mark plural where there is some semantic reminder that the noun is to be so marked, especially where the reminder is strong or unambiguous. Two additional factors appeared to play a part in plural marking. One was separation of the noun from the plural-indicating marker, and the other was a specific phonological environment, the ending of the stem form in the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s). Examination of secondary material supported these findings. Possible influence of the background language (Chinese) is discussed and similar findings for Singapore English are examined.

description950=Questions about the appropriate approach to bilingual or multilingual education are discussed. It is noted that bilingualism was formerly reserved for the elite but that bilingual education should be available to all since it promotes a better understanding of world differences. A few examples (Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Belgium, and Switzerland) are cited to illustrate various approaches to bilingual education, including issues of language of instruction and the language proficiency of citizens. In Brunei Darussalam, as in India and Tunisia, languages are offered according to subjects taught. Implications of such language policy are considered. It is suggested that policymakers must remember that two languages are involved (not just the second language) and that strict bilingualism, in which students do not have a first language, may produce students without a soul or a country. It is concluded that education should start with the first language, preferably the home language, and introduce second or third languages after a few years of formal education in the first. Contains 6 references. (LB)

description949=Adventure Cove Waterpark Category\: Recreational & Civic Country\: Singapore Year of Completion\: 2012 Client\: Resorts World Sentosa Pte Ltd Resort World Sentosa’s (RWS) Adventure Cove Waterpark is an aquatic adventure park consisting of six water slides, a wave pool, kids play zone, interactive splash pool and a 820 metre long winding thematic lazy river, that is assimilated with the Marine Life Park and Dolphin Pool attractions that are open to sky. As Singapore’s first integrated resort that possesses series of extreme rides and attractions, the water theme park rides played a vital role in contribution to the refinement of today’s authority codes, standards definition, submission-approval and licensing processes for future developments. DP Consultant’s (DPC) had to ensure that construction took place within suitable standards of safety and quality both from the point of view of resources and time as well as the contract parameters prescribed by RWS. With that, DP Consultants had to address and overcome challenges of strict micro targets and close tracking and coordination control of multiple construction and system processes timelines; coupled with the project, resources and contracts dynamics, challenging site utilization permissibility with limited ingress and egress points for access, restrictive manoeuvring within the laterally dense building-up of specialty works and attractions, all within close proximity of the partially opened and operating attractions and hospitality buildings already receiving guest.. Whilst the coordination and planning of construction activities are the fundamental requirements of the contractor, DPC needed a thorough understanding of the construction processes to identify and prevent potential risks that may compromise the client’s objectives. DPC undertook advanced planning of engagements with agencies to manage the potential risks that could arise under various project circumstances and completion states, so that the series of TOP approval milestones were not derailed. DPC adopted diverse and innovative techniques to propel the project forward within an accelerated timeline. Critical Path Analysis, continuous Risk Assessment Checks and Mitigations, and various forms of Program Evaluation & Review Techniques were employed throughout various stages of the project to ascertain that all required works were completed effectively and efficiently within time and the structured contractual context. Additionally, DPC adopted a holistic approach to Project Management that not only involved the standard PM tools, systems and processes, but also the use of psychological and motivational tools including the generation of eye catching posters with memorable slogans to steer and align the entire Project Team towards common goals Marine Life Park & SEA Aquarium Category\: Recreational & Civic Country\: Singapore Year of Completion\: 2012 Client\: Resorts World Sentosa Pte Ltd Size\: 9,400sqm Resorts World Sentosa’s (RWS) Marine Life Park and SEA Aquarium houses one of the Worlds largest aquariums and 49 smaller habitats that feature more than 100,000 marine animals from over 800 species. The major marine life attractions and exhibits involved intense design, procurement strategy planning within Client’s requirements, specialist technical coordination, site management, on and off-site logistics planning, progress supervision and construction support to supplement the main contractor. The achievements in construction , testing, commissioning and operational readiness of these aquatic tanks, marine life pool attractions and its filtration system (processing an approximately 43 million cubic litre of water) proved to be challenging for the remaining West Zone components as works continued within a partially operating integrated resort. It was a complicated and intricate fusion of many specialist subcontractor works that had to be managed correctly as they had marginal or absolute zero tolerances for errors due to restrictive timelines. Specialist works included (but not limited to)\: * Extensive tanking and PTFE canopy structures * Large logistic movement programming for deliveries * On-site annealing & installation of acrylic panels * Stack building up of large life support infrastructures, equipment & system assemblies (LSS) in tight spaces * In-tank Creative thematic artificial environmental rockscape and coral works * Filtration system testing * Preparation of tanks to introduce the aquatic species...

description941=The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) in Singapore provides skills training to school leavers through the institutional training and apprenticeship modes. The strengths of apprenticeship training are\: provision of more occupational choices; greater effectiveness in meeting specific needs of industries; and opportunities for young people to earn as they learn. Programs offered under apprenticeship training lead to national technical and specific trade area certification. All apprenticeship courses encompass the two key components of on-the-job and off-the-job training. The ITE has a specified center for promotion, recruitment, and placement--the Apprenticeship Placement Center. The ITE also monitors the placed apprentices' progress for the full duration of training. Fifty-seven courses are offered under apprenticeship. Three key actions meet the challenge of increasing the participation of young persons\: strengthening the image of apprenticeship, promoting apprenticeship, and introducing new programs. Strategies to overcome the barriers to participation of small and medium-sized companies include the following\: introduction of a hybrid option, progressive disbursement of grants, support from ITE on the cost of training, provision of more places for off-the-job training, and establishment of the Council on Apprenticeship Training. Quality of training has been strengthened through support from Germany and training of industry trainers. (The appendices contain a list of apprenticeship courses, enrollment figures by course, and number of organizations participating by course.) (YLB)
description940=Little is known about how online learning may be used to disseminate health information rapidly and widely to large university populations if there is an infectious disease outbreak. During the SARS outbreak in Singapore in 2003, a six-lesson elearning module on SARS was developed for a large university population of 32,000 students. The module was developed within 2 months by 12 academic staff from medicine, economics, basic science, health promotion, microbiology, epidemiology and public health with support from 2 IT experts and 2 support staff. To ensure coverage of the entire student population, all students were required to complete the module within 9 months of its implementation to fulfill the graduation requirement. About 5,000 (16%) students read the module within the first month and almost all (96%) within 9 months of its implementation. The majority (86%) of the students who took the module for credits passed the module. Using this online format, health information was disseminated rapidly and efficiently to all university students during the SARS outbreak. This module could be adapted to other institutions with Internet support to disseminate timely health messages efficiently should an infectious disease outbreak occur.

description939=This collection of four papers deals with problem solving and the measurement of problem solving. "Climbing Up the Competence Ladder\: Some Thoughts on Meaningful Assessment of Problem-Solving Tasks in the Classroom" by K. C. Cheung uses the metaphor of a competence ladder to represent the problem-solving continuum with progressive qualitative bands. "A Bane or a Boon?\: Meaningful Assessment of Problem-Solving Activities in the Classroom" by K. C. Cheung and L. C. Mooi explores different ways of assessing problem-solving activities and describes a conceptual framework for problem-solving processes. ""On Meaningful Measurement\: Stages of Lower Secondary Pupils' Abilities in Solving Algebra Word Problems" by W. F. Loh and K. C. Cheung outlines the critical steps experienced by 130 eighth-graders in Singapore in solving word problems and explains how these activities could be assessed. "On Meaningful Measurement\: Metacognition and Hierarchical Modelling of Errors in Algebra Word Problems" by K. C. Cheung and W. F. Loh analyzes the main types of errors made by 130 eighth-graders at different performance levels. A 43-item list of references is included. An appendix contains the algebra test from the fourth study. (SLD)

description938=A new report from the Coastal Resources Commission's Science Panel on Coastal Hazards (SPCH) reveals that North Carolina coast is gradually getting lapped by the sea.   Naturally, this is not just an issue that's exclusive to North Carolina as climate change is resulting in stronger typhoons and worse flooding around the world -- it is, however, one of the highly-prone locations.   That's according to the detailed document released by the SPCH based on tidal gauge measurements collected from Southport, Beaufort, Oregon Inlet, Duck and Wilmington. Data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also served as their basis for the 43-page report which projects higher sea levels in three decades. It predicts Duck's sea level will increase by 4-10 inches in 2045, while Southport's is expected to rise 2-9 inches.   The Keeley Consulting Group considers the report on sea level as a critical one, especially when the coastal and homeowners welfare are taken into account. And according to Professor Stanley Riggs of Department of Geological Sciences (East Carolina University), the numbers may not sound alarming but the effects could be.   "There are two different things\: One is the long-term change going on in the globe -- slow, systematic. You also have the short-term. The short-term ranges from daily tides to storm surges -- 5, 10, 15, 20-foot change in sea levels in hours," Riggs said.   The bottom line is, as the sea levels gradually increase, short-term effects also worsen. Therefore, he fears that many houses along the coast of North Carolina won't even reach 30 years -- if there's no federal funding to improve the problematic areas anyway.   This recent report serves as an update to the previous one the SPCH published in 2010 where they calculated the rise of sea level in 100 years to be around 15-55 inches. However, as Riggs put it, "the public didn't quite get the 100-year thing". So this time, the SPCH was told to only estimate the sea level rise for the next 3 decades.   Meanwhile, another SPCH member and coastal construction expert, Spencer Rogers, de-emphasizes the report's projections of larger storms and frequent flooding. According to him, coastal areas are already working on plans to counteract the sea level rise.   Environmental advocates also expressed their views that the passive approach of the state won't be enough to alleviate possible damage, much less to address the root cause which is climate change.

description937=This paper presents two numerical cases of disturbed Navier-Stokes equations. In case 1, four order accuracy finite difference is used to investigate the evolution of negative frequency disturbance in Blasius boundary layer, results show us that negative frequency can reduce the streamwise wavelength of T-S wave, and accelerate the transition process. The effect of negative frequency lets to the breakdown of fluid structure becomes more significant. And, in the case two, two order accuracy finite volume method is used, Reynolds number is 900, and dimensionless frequency F is 86 in this case. Results present that the evolution process is more gradual in the positive frequency compare with the negative frequency in case 1. And the pressure contours clearly present a nonlinear interaction and break down process of two lambda vortexes.

description936=This article is from Health and Quality of Life Outcomes , volume 10 . Abstract Background\: Quality of life (QoL) assessment has become an important aspect of the clinical management of gastric cancer (GC), which poses a greater health threat in Chinese populations around the world. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gastric Module (FACT-Ga), a questionnaire developed specifically to measure QoL of patients with GC, has never been validated in Chinese subjects. The current study was designed to examine the psychometric properties of FACT-Ga as a GC specific QoL instrument for its future use in Chinese populations. Methods\: A sample of 67 Chinese patients with GC in the National University Hospital, Singapore was investigated cross-sectionally. The participants independently completed either English or Chinese versions of the FACT-Ga and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). Reliability was measured as the Cronbach’s α for EQ-5D, and five subscale scores and two total scores of FACT-Ga. The sensitivity to patients’ clinical status was evaluated by comparing EQ-5D and FACT-Ga scores between clinical subgroups classified by Clinical Stage and Treatment Intent. The construct validity of FACT-Ga was assessed internally by examining the item-to-scale correlations and externally by contrasting the FACT-Ga subscales with the EQ-5D domains. Results\: For both FACT-Ga and EQ-5D, patients treated with curative intent rated their QoL higher than those treated for palliation, and early stage patients scored higher than those in the late stage. The sensitivity to clinical status of FACT-Ga scores were differential as four of seven FACT-Ga scores were significant for Treatment Intent while only one subscale score was significant for Clinical Stage. Six FACT-Ga scores had Cronbach’s α of 0.8 or above indicating excellent reliability. For construct validity, 45 of 46 items converged about their respective subscales. The monotrait-multimethod correlations between QoL constructs of FACT-Ga and EQ-5D were stronger than the multitrait-multimethod correlations as theoretically hypothesized, suggesting good convergent and discriminant validities. Conclusions\: Given the excellent reliability and good construct validity, FACT-Ga scores are able to distinguish patient groups with different clinical characteristics in the expected direction. Therefore FACT-Ga can be used as a discriminative instrument for measuring QoL of Chinese patients with GC.

description934=Across the educational systems of the world, few issues have received more attention in recent years than the problem of ensuring that elementary and secondary-school classrooms are all staffed with adequately qualified teachers. The objective of this report is to present the results from a collaborative, comparative study, that examined the preparation and qualifications of elementary and secondary teachers in six nations and one autonomous region\: China, Hong Kong , Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. Unlike other recent cross-national teacher studies, this project adopted a relatively specific focus on one key issue linked to the performance and quality of teachers--the qualifications and preparation of teachers. The objective of the study was to compare how each system itself defines teacher qualifications and standards and then to address the question\: how well are the different educational systems succeeding in ensuring all students are taught by qualified teachers? The study addressed this overarching issue by examining comparative data from each of the seven educational systems on three specific research questions\: (1) What are the preparation requirements and standards to become a teacher?; (2) What are the levels of qualifications of the current teaching force?; and (3) What proportions of teachers are not qualified in the subjects they teach? The report is organized into the following chapters\: (1) A Comparative Study of Teacher Preparation and Qualifications in Six Nations (Richard M. Ingersoll); (2) The Qualifications of the Teaching Force in China (Ding Gang and Sun Meilu); (3) The Qualifications of the Teaching Force in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Kwok Chan Lai); (4) The Qualifications of the Teaching Force in Japan (Hidenori Fujita with Walter Putnam Dawson); (5) The Quality and Qualifications of the Teaching Force in the Republic of Korea (Ee-gyeong Kim); (6) The Qualifications of the Teaching Force\: Data from Singapore (Steven K. S. Tan and Angela F. L. Wong with S. Gopinathan, Kim Chuan Goh, Isabella Y. F. Wong, and Kong Hong Ong); (7) The Qualifications of the Teaching Force in Thailand (Pruet Siribanpitak and Siriporn Boonyananta); and (8) The Preparation and Qualifications of the Teaching Force in the United States (Richard M. Ingersoll). (Contains 55 tables and 6 figures.) [Individual chapters contain references.]

description921=As a scholar/practitioner who has been involved for more than forty years in efforts to improve urban schools and districts, the author is struck by the confluence of factors that seem to be coming together to support this major new effort to rescue the neediest students in urban America. Is it possible that the idealism of the 1960s is finally going to be connected in a practical way to the resources provided by the federal and state government, along with the largesse of the foundations and nonprofit world? In the spirit of advancing this agenda and adding to it, the author offers some alternative policy options that should be considered if the nation is serious about the rescue of its neediest students in urban America. These are\: (1) Fund some demonstration projects in America's urban districts that are willing to use the approach of Scandinavian and Asian countries like Finland and Singapore in pursuing teacher excellence; (2) Provide more federal research money to study the best instructional practices of America's higher performing urban districts; (3) Study the administrative support structure at hard-to-staff urban schools; (4) Pilot statewide collective bargaining in some large states; and (5) Provide new federal research funds to study governance in large urban school systems.

description916=This case study investigates whether teachers model reading in 1 Singapore primary school during an exercise called "uninterrupted sustained silent reading" (USSR) carried out in the classroom. Even though reading is an important determinant of a student's growth in language skills and ability, and modeling the act of reading is essential in influencing students, we hypothesize that teachers do not model the act of reading. This study seeks to find out if teachers practice what they preach about reading by making the effort to model the act of reading. This study uses an observation log, questionnaire surveys, and semi-structured interviews. Fifty teachers were observed during USSR daily for 10 weeks and surveyed. Purposeful and systematic samplings were used to identify the teachers for the interviews. The study confirms our hypothesis that even though the teachers believe in the importance of reading and modeling, they do not model reading. (Contains 3 tables.)

description915=Although foremost among the benefits of cooperative learning is improvement of student academic achievement, additional affective benefits may further convince teachers that the value added by cooperative learning is worth the effort. This study examined the effect of an 8-month cooperative learning intervention on children's friendship choices in a Singapore elementary school. Four primary 5 classes, comprising 151 students, participated in the cooperative learning and four primary 5 classes, comprising 164 students, did not. All students were 11 years old. Between 76 and 81 percent of the students were Chinese, and the other ethnic groups represented were Indian, Eurasian, and Malay. Data were collected through sociometric surveys conducted before and after cooperative learning was used in social studies classes. The findings indicated that after 8 months of learning in cooperative groups, children in the experimental groups showed significant gains in percentage of cross-race choices of friends. Target diagrams of the sociometry survey indicated, however, that children still showed a distinct tendency to select friends among the same race. Also, getting pupils to work collaboratively in heterogeneous groups did not seem to produce gains in acceptance of low status children. Inherent in groupwork are problems of status and personality, and the teacher plays an important role in integrated rejected and neglected children. (Contains 18 references.) (KB)

description912=Includes bibliographical references (pages 285-287) and index\nFrom the early Christian era in Europe, Southeast Asia was known as the "Land of Gold." It is a region blessed with a rich diversity of cultures, peoples, and scenery. A Traveller's History of Southeast Asia is a lucid and concise introduction to the histories of the modern states of Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Singapore, Brunei and East Timor, providing an essential guide for both tourist and the general reader alike. It spans the history of the region from "Java Man" some one million years ago to the development of the high-tech, skyscraper cities of the new millennium. Following chapters on the physical environment and the earliest human history of Southeast Asia, the authors carry the reader through the classical kingdoms that produced such architectural marvels as Borobudur in Java and Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The book further explores Southeast Asia's growing trade with the outside world from 1500 culminating in colonization by the European imperial powers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The struggles for independence in the last century -- which made the modern nations of the region -- are discussed in detail, as are the dramatic and tragic events of the post-independence era such as the Vietnam War and the Cambodia genocide. The remarkable successes and failings of the region's recent economic development are highlighted in the final chapter. Above all A Traveller's History of Southeast Asia shows how the region's soul has been preserved against tremendous external pressures\nChronicles the history and background of Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malasia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam\n

description910=The constructs of concrete and formal operational reasoning were examined in 459 15-year-old secondary school students (234 males and 225 females) in Singapore. Log linear models were used to explore the relationships between Piagetian level of reasoning, the level of intelligence, gender, and type of home-speaking environment among these adolescents. Instruments used were the pendulum task of Shayer's Science Reasoning Task and Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices. The formal operational level is associated with a higher level of intelligence and English-speaking homes, and has gender differences in favor of the males. It is possible that students from Chinese-speaking homes may not have comprehended the questions fully. More research is needed to address this problem. Three tables present study findings and analysis results. (SLD)

description2099=Thesis--University of Toronto volume 2 found here\: British naval strategy in the Far East, 1919-1942 \: a study of priorities in the question of imperial defense The foundation of the British Empire was predicated on a basic unwritten contract between the Pacific Dominions, Britain’s Far Eastern Empire and that of the United Kingdom\: when threatened the Dominions would come to the aid of the mother country. The converse is that if the Dominions were imperiled, the United Kingdom would sacrifice all other strategic priorities (with the exception of the defence of the UK itself) and rush to their aid. But at the end of the First World War, the British, once master of every sea they surveyed, now found themselves facing an isolationist United States, an aggressive Japan and a series of minor conflicts within the Empire. My thesis analyses the events that led up to Singapore becoming a major naval base. It examines why the strategy based on Singapore failed. It looks at the major factors involved, such as the role of the U.S. in strategic planning over the period 1919-1942. This was so particularly with the end of the Anglo-Japanese alliance of 1902. The sidebar issues include the underestimation of the Japanese capability, much of which was founded on basic racism. But the essential issue was paying for and manning a two-ocean navy. Defending two-oceans with a one-ocean navy was clearly impossible, unless the British could find an ally, most logically, the U.S., which was, at the time, singularly uninterested. That said, my thesis examines the evolution of British strategy for defending her Pacific and Far Eastern Empire. The lynch pin of that strategy was the development of the huge Singapore Naval Base whose strategic location would prevent a Japanese attack into the Indian Ocean or south to the Dominions. It soon became known as the Gibraltar of the Far East, impregnable, standing guard over one of the world’s most important waterways. I argue that it was a strategy fraught with contradictions, changing priorities, dubious conclusions and illusions, and a consistent liberality with the truth when it came to promises to defend Australia and New Zealand. Much of this was exposed when Japanese soldiers, in a savage 70-day campaign stormed down the Malay peninsula. On February 15, 1942 the Japanese accepted the surrender of Singapore . It was the greatest military disaster in modern British history. Over 100,000 British, Dominion and Imperial soldiers were now about to endure the brutality of Japanese POW camps where thousands died.\nVita\nBibliography\: leaves 485-536\n34 52\nNEW\n

description2096=This cross-cultural study compared the lives of Chinese children and British expatriate children, assessed the children's perception of potentially stressful life events, and examined the relationship between the children's cognitive maturity and their adjustment skills. Subjects were 25 British preschool children living in Singapore and 25 local Singaporean Chinese children between the ages of 4 and 6 years. The two stressors examined in this study were separation anxiety and relocation anxiety. Four measures used were the Children's Life Events Inventory, children's self-report of a potentially stressful life event, the Teacher Rating Scale of Children's Adaptive Behavior, and the Teacher Rating Scale of Children's Cognitive Maturity. Analysis showed that the two cultural groups appeared to be experiencing both qualitatively and quantitatively different potentially stressful life events. British expatriate children experienced more stressors, had more difficulty adapting to new situations or events, and were less cognitively mature than Singaporean Chinese children. No gender differences in children's perceptions of separation anxiety were found. The measures used in this study can assist parents and teachers in identifying children most vulnerable to stress.

description2094=This collection of research papers considers extensions of the Rasch model. In Chapter 1, K. C. Cheung explains how measurement and testing in the classroom can be made more meaningful, particularly through the use of Rasch family item response models. In Chapter 2, K. W. Koon and K. C. Cheung apply the Rasch model in constructing a part-whole concept continuum in mathematics. In Chapter 3, using a different conceptual framework, S. K. Cheung and M. L. Choo use the Rasch model to establish a proposed hierarchy of language skills. In Chapter 4, M. L. Choo and K. C. Cheung use Rating Scale Analysis--an extension of the Rasch model--to check on a newly constructed computer programming anxiety instrument normed on a sample of computer science students in junior colleges in Singapore. These papers demonstrate that it is possible to base qualitative interpretation on quantitative measurement. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 show that meaningful measurement is possible in the classroom. Five figures and two tables present supporting data. A 40-item list of references is attached. A multiple-choice test on fractions, and the computer programming anxiety scale are included. (SLD)

description2093=A study examined learning strategies used by secondary school students in Singapore who were streamed into special, express, or normal high school curriculum courses according to their ability. The sample was drawn from nine schools, three schools for each stream. Participants were 1,165 eighth and tenth graders. Measures included Biggs' Learning Process Questionnaire items and additional items concerning languages, social studies, mathematics, and sciences. Findings based on responses to English and mathematics questionnaires revealed significant differences in the choice of learning strategies of students in the normal track and those in the other two tracks. Students in the normal track indicated use of inappropriate learning strategies in both language and mathematics courses. Further examination seems to suggest that normal students lacked confidence and security. Strategies used by students in the special and express tracks indicated that they understood the special features of the subjects and had the confidence needed to explore alternative routes in problem solving. It is concluded that if normal track pupils are to achieve satisfactory scores on academic examinations, they may have to revise their learning strategies. However, they may not be able to do so without help from their teachers. English and mathematics learning strategy questionnaires are included in the text. (RH)

description908=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: Pain is a prominent feature of acute dengue as well as a clinical criterion in World Health Organization guidelines in diagnosing dengue. We conducted a prospective cohort study to compare levels of pain during acute dengue between different ethnicities and dengue severity. Methods\: Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected. Data on self-reported pain was collected using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale. Generalized structural equation models were built to predict progression to severe disease. Results\: A total of 499 laboratory confirmed dengue patients were recruited in the Prospective Adult Dengue Study at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. We found no statistically significant differences between pain score with age, gender, ethnicity or the presence of co-morbidity. Pain score was not predictive of dengue severity but highly correlated to patients’ day of illness. Prevalence of abdominal pain in our cohort was 19%. There was no difference in abdominal pain score between grades of dengue severity. Conclusion\: Dengue is a painful disease. Patients suffer more pain at the earlier phase of illness. However, pain score cannot be used to predict a patient’s progression to severe disease.

description907=The Desire, Ability, Means, and Need (DAMN) Cycle is a useful paradigm for understanding the lifelong learning framework in Singapore. The cycle suggests that, for learning to occur, students must have a desire and an ability to learn, including inquiring minds and higher order process skills; the means must be provided through a well-defined educational infrastructure and appropriate teaching models; and a perceived need must exist for education or training. In Singapore, the educational system and societal pressures lead students to desire success in examinations more than learning itself. This issue is being addressed by modifying the examination system, trimming school curriculum, and increasing the use of information technology in the classroom. Students' impressive achievements in school performance may also rest merely on exam-smart skills rather than true cognitive intelligence. As a result, structured programs have been implemented that require utilization of analytical skills that prepare for higher education. The means for lifelong learning is being provided in the country through programs that promote learner-centered approaches and the teaching of thinking skills. To fully implement lifelong learning, Singapore should develop regional cooperation and a systems approach to maximize resources; focus on both national and international contexts; and address problems related to parochialism, assessment benchmarks, and funding sources.

description900=As the world evolves, so does the demand for jobs. There may be departments and workloads the world now doesn’t have. What would be the classified ads look like in the near future? In five years? Perhaps 10 more years?    What does it concern you if there will be new jobs?  Westhill Consulting and Employment thinks it is important to structure your career now so that when the time comes for your work to be in demand, you will on the top of the game. In recent reviews, here are the top careers predicted to have a big impact in the future\: 1. Healthcare According to recent Labor Department data, an aging population will put healthcare workers such as doctors, nurses, physical therapists, home health aids, and pharmacists in more demand.  Developing nations will need more and more health workers as the world begins to turn its back to a healthier lifestyle.    Less-skilled and lower paid workers such as aides may require as little as a certification course, depending upon the state they are living and working in, while doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and pharmacists require specialized schooling after graduating from college.  2. Information Technology This may be one of the obvious fields to boom in the near future. Think of all the technology we didn’t have just a few decades ago. Computers, internet, smartphones have changed business and communication. As technology slowly becomes more developed, IT professionals such as programmers and security specialist are in high demand.  Those in this kind of field are enjoying analytical skills but should also be creative problem solvers. Asia is currently considered as home of IT specialists with promising practitioners from India, Jakarta, Indonesia and Singapore 3. Alternative Energy People are currently realizing the problems we are facing in the environment. With warnings on natural hazards, calamities and disasters, people have become more conscious of energy utilization and will continue to do so. In response, alternative energy is being sought after as solution to the worsening uneven global climate.    Don't say good-bye to oil and gas quite yet, but alternative energies such as wind power, hydrogen power, geothermal power, and solar power will create dozens of new careers, from mechanics and plant managers to scientists, engineers, and even sales and marketing professionals, as these energies become more mainstream  4. Ethical Hacker Is it possible for a hacker to be ethical? It turns out that many companies hire these experts to purposefully hack systems in order to pinpoint problems in security measures before their less-ethical counterparts get the chance. You can even become a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), a professional who’s tasked with network policy creation, intrusion detection and virus creation.

description2073=Construction companies may be a little bit desperate at this time of need. Without realizing it, the industry is already doing actions which go against governing laws of different countries. While the public remains oblivious to the growing issue of the saturation of manpower in construction industries, a lot of workers take advantage of the demand to apply, albeit illegally, in various construction-related businesses in the last couple of years. Axis Capital Group , a company which sells and rents capital equipment based in Singapore has reportedly exiled eight illegal workers who tried to apply to the company’s sub office in Jakarta, Indonesia. The workers were of Malaysian and Thailand nationalities. In Singapore, the leading country in construction industry, similar cases were also filed. Fraudulent workers are known to have come from Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. In addition, the expansion of the middle class and women’s increasing entry into labor market has triggered a rise in demand for foreign manpower. Singapore allows migrant workers in the country provided that they pass the visa requirements\: 1. semi-permanent residents with semi-permanent work permits who are allowed to take any job anywhere in Singapore (valid for five years); 2. foreign professionals with annual permits called employment passes which are issued only for specific jobs and for a specific duration (valid for one to five years); 3. Seasonal workers with short-term permits usually valid for two years (subject to renewal). Some illegal migrants enter the country by sea or through the assistance of fellow illegal workers. Since the fluency of native language is required for those in construction sector, these illegal migrants first apply for a tourist visa in the country; mingle with the locals and finally applying with knowledge of basic sentences and jargons. Malaysia has the similar issue with the increasing illegal labor. Over-dependence on foreign workers and the negative impacts induced have become a serious social problem. In legit cases, there are also countries that are left with no choice but to employ foreign workers. Japan is even reviewing and revising its bylaws to allow foreigners into their construction industry. The country may let more foreign workers from Asia work at construction sites under an on-the-job training system ahead of the construction boom. At present, some 70% of foreign construction workers under the on-the-job training program are from China.

description2052=This article is from Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders EXTRA , volume 2 . Abstract Background\: Early detection of dementia aims to improve treatment outcomes. However, poor perception and understanding of dementia are significant barriers. We aim to investigate the public's perception of dementia and identify variables associated with the different profiles of public perception. Methods\: A custom-designed questionnaire was used to assess laypersons’ knowledge and perception of dementia during a health fair at a public hospital in Singapore, a developed Asian nation. Out of a sample of 370 subjects, 32 declined to participate (response rate \= 91.4%). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify meaningful subgroups of subjects from significant associations with multiple indicators of dementia awareness. Multinomial logistic regression was performed exploring variables associated with each of the subgroups derived from LCA. Results\: The majority of the study participants were female (66.9%), 65 years or older (71.1%), and ethnic Chinese (88.1%). LCA classified the study participants into 3 subgroups\: Class 1 (good knowledge, good attitude), Class 2 (good knowledge, poor attitude), and Class 3 (poor knowledge, poor attitude), in proportions of 14.28, 63.83, and 21.88%, respectively. Compared to other classes, participants with good knowledge and good attitude towards dementia (Class 1) were more likely to know someone with dementia and understand the effects of the disease, be married, live in private housing, receive higher monthly income, and not profess belief in Buddhism, Taoism, or Hinduism. Conclusion\: Our results show that the public in Singapore may not be ready for screening initiatives and early dementia diagnosis. Education efforts should be targeted at lower socioeconomic groups, singles, and those of certain oriental religions.

description2042=This article is from Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics , volume 9 . Abstract Aim\: This study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of tetravalent measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine produced with measles and rubella monovalent bulks derived from a newly established working seed virus stock (MMRVnew WS) compared with the combined MMRV vaccine derived from the current seed virus stock, in Taiwanese and Singaporean children (NCT00892775).Methods\:Healthy children aged 11–22 mo were randomized to receive two doses of either the MMRV new WS vaccine or the MMRV vaccine. Antibody titers against measles, mumps and rubella were measured using ELISA and against varicella using an immunofluorescence assay. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of MMRVnew WS to MMRV in terms of post-dose-1 seroconversion rates, defined as a group difference with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval greater than -10% for each antigen. Parents/guardians recorded symptoms in diary cards for 43 d after each vaccine dose.Results\:Non-inferiority of MMRV new WS to MMRV was achieved for all vaccine antigens. The lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals for group differences (MMRVnew WS group vs. MMRV) for measles (99.4% vs 100%), mumps (89.7% vs 90.4%), rubella (99.7% vs 100%) and varicella (97.6% vs 92.9%) seroconversion rates were greater than -10%. Mild symptoms including a peak in fever between days 5 and 12, post-dose-1, was observed in both groups.Conclusion\:The immune responses elicited by the MMRV new WS vaccine were non-inferior to that elicited by the MMRV vaccine for all antigens. Both vaccines exhibited an acceptable safety profile in Taiwanese and Singaporean children.

As the Internet develops into a global commercial infrastructure, demands for guaranteed and differentiated network quality of service (QoS) will increase rapidly. Several QoS service models have been developed to provide and support QOS in the Internet, namely\: Integrated Service (IntServ), Differentiated Service (DiffServ) and MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS). QoS routing, such as Widest-Shortest Path, Shortest-Widest Path and Shortest-Distance Path, is required in order to support QoS and optimize the network resource utilization. The Server and Agent based Active network Management (SAAM) system is a network management system designed for the next generation Internet. It is capable of supporting all types of service. It will be able to control and optimize the utilization of the network through resource allocation and adaptive QOS routing. This thesis describes a design and implementation of the QoS Management component of a SAAM Server. This component optimizes the utilization of network resources and supports the various service classes in a cohesive manner. It utilizes an adaptive routing strategy to balance the network load\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat reader\nSingapore Ministry of Defense author (civilian)\ndk/dk cc\:9116 07/11/2000\n

description2036=This report summarizes an educational forum organized by the International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) and held in Genting, Malaysia on November 6-8, 1990, to discuss the experience of student loans in Australia, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. In addition, the forum explored arguments for and against loans as a means of providing financial support for students, and examined the reasons that some countries in the region have adopted loans as a way of financing higher education, while others have rejected the idea. Following an introductory chapter, the report discusses\: (1) the existing patterns of finance for higher education and systems of student support; (2) the reasons for interest in student loans; (3) the administration of loan programs; and (4) the feasibility of student loans and their role in educational finance. Appendices include summaries of student support systems from each of the countries involved in the study. Contains 17 references. (GLR)

description2035=The learning approaches of secondary students were studied for 495 eighth-, tenth- and twelfth-grade students in Singapore. The focus was on determining\: (1) the dominant approach used by students in learning different academic subjects (English, Chinese, mathematics, and science); (2) the motive-strategy consequence in learning these different subjects in grades 8, 10, and 12; and (3) the different learning approaches used by better (express) and weaker (normal) students. Normal students were motivated to learn the subject for its usefulness to them; express students were more likely to have intrinsic interest in the subject. Normal students were more likely to use rote learning and to rely heavily on teachers' notes and past examinations, while express students were more likely to look for relationships between new and old concepts learned, showing a more reflective approach in their learning. The express students used effective retention strategies more frequently and exhibited better examination techniques than did normal students. Overall, when strategies were viewed in terms identified by J. Biggs (1979), these secondary students, irrespective of grade and subject, showed a preference for deep and achieving strategies. That weaker students were more likely to favor the Surface Approach was an expected finding, but one educators should consider in their efforts to help weak learners. Six data tables are included.

description2034=The main objective of this Working Paper is to show a set of indicators on the knowledge-based economy for China, mainly compiled from databases within EAS, although data from databases maintained by other parts of the OECD are included as well. These indicators are put in context by comparison with data for the United States, Japan and the EU (or the G7 countries in case no EU totals are available) and data for some of the Asian neighbours of China (Korea, Singapore, Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong) where data for these countries were readily available. This document draws heavily on the Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard, copying many of the indicators presented there and borrowing a substantial amount of contextual and methodological explanations. After listing the main outcomes of this study, the paper starts with a section on the economic structure of China and the other economies, followed by a set of trade indicators, showing the opening up of China's economy and the growing importance of trade in high-technology products. Two indicators of foreign investment in China are examined\: foreign affiliates and foreign direct investment. Recognizing the importance of human resources to a knowledge-based economy, a range of human resources indicators is presented. Final sections present indicators on R&D (as one of the inputs to the innovation process), and patents (as one of the outputs). A statistical annex brings together a selection of tables of the main indicators shown in the document. OECD database information is also annexed. (A bibliography is included. Contains 11 footnotes, 60 figures, 5 boxes and 26 tables.)

They give an overview of the philosophy and work of extension departments in some of the universities of Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. "University Extension and Community Service in Malaysia" (Saidin Teh, et al.) discusses extension and community service activities that have been and will continue to be undertaken by four universities. "The Role and Efforts of Prince of Songkla University in Community and Rural Development" (Chamnarn Pratoomsindh) describes the design and improvement of educational programs and projects directed toward the development of the Southern Thailand region. "Ramkhamhaeng University\: Experiences in Extension Programmes" (Pat Noisaengsri, Usa Korntaptim) provides an overview of the university's programs in general and distance/extension education in particular. The paper, "Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University\: Thailand" (Wichit Srisa-an), which was not presented at the seminar, is included because it provides an example of the innovative developments taking place in the area of widening access to universities in the region.

description2032=Chronic Regulatory Focus and Financial Decision-Making\: Asset and Portfolio Allocation Author\: Navin Kumar Published by Springer Singapore ISBN\: 978-981-287-693-5 DOI\: 10.1007/978-981-287-694-2 Table of Contents\: Introduction Literature Review Theoretical Framework Research Methodology Results General Discussion Conclusion\nChapter 1\: Introduction -- Chapter 2\: Literature review -- Chapter 3\: Theoretical framework -- Chapter 4\: Research methodology -- Chapter 5\: Results -- Chapter 6\: General discussion -- Chapter 7\: Conclusion.- Appendix.- References\nIn this book, the relationship between financial decision-making and chronic regulatory focus is explored to provide a better understanding of consumer decisions. Financial decisions are modelled on the basis of assets and portfolios sensitive to particular regulatory foci. Studies in the book test whether participants select assets/portfolios that conform to their respective foci. In addition, given that gender, age and education can shape financial decisions, further hypotheses are put forth to explore whether these are related to asset and portfolio selection and regulatory focus. As consumers tend to make financial decisions prior to priming, this book diverts from previous research involving primed states of regulatory focus and instead explores the chronic state. The study employs two complementary instruments, the eye tracker and self-report, to explicate the hypotheses. As the main hypotheses were not supported, the author posits that the harsh worldwide financial climate may have acted as an external influence, moving participants to select assets and portfolios not aligned with their foci. This study marks a valuable contribution to the current literature concerning financial decision-making, the underlying motivational systems and external influences, and will promote further research in these areas. It offers an essential resource for academics and students interested in how regulatory focus interacts with financial decisions and the overarching economic climate\n

description90=This article is from Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care , volume 2 . Abstract Family Medicine in Singapore has its roots in a generalist ethos and found its origin as a counter culture movement to the increasing sub-specialisation of medicine which resulted in a complex healthcare system where that patients are often cared for by multiple specialists potentially resulting in fragmentation of care. The aim of the discipline of Family Medicine was to train and develop more generalist physicians so as to promote holistic care. Family physicians are the largest pool of generalists who are trained to provide general medical care to patients in the context of the person, the family and the community that they live in.
description2027=Explicit birational geometry of 3-folds represents a second phase of Mori theory, going beyond the foundational work of the 1980s. This paper is a tutorial and colloquial introduction to the explicit classification of Fano 3-folds (Q-Fano 3-folds), a subject that we hope is nearing completion. With the intention of remaining accessible to beginners in algebraic geometry, we include examples of elementary calculations of graded rings over curves and K3 surfaces. For us, K3 surfaces have at worst Du Val singularities and are polarised by an ample Weil divisor; they occur as the general elephant of a Fano 3-fold. A second section of the paper runs briefly through the classical theory of nonsingular Fano 3-folds and Mukai's extension to indecomposable Gorenstein Fano 3-folds. Ideas sketched out by Takagi at the Singapore conference reduce the study of Q-Fano 3-folds with g>\=2 to indecomposable Gorenstein Fano 3-folds together with unprojection data. Much of the information about the anticanonical ring of a Fano 3-fold or K3 surface is contained in its Hilbert series. The Hilbert function is given by orbifold Riemann--Roch (see Reid's Young Person's Guide); using this, we can treat the Hilbert series as a simple collation of the genus and a basket of cyclic quotient singularities. Many hundreds of families of K3s and Fano 3-folds are known, among them a large number with g

While some regions make strides towards improving the living conditions of their citizens, Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, is still trapped in poverty with more than 40% of its 600 million people living below the internationally recognized absolute poverty line of one US dollar per day. Poor governance and corruption should be highlighted as the most important systemic factors contributing to poverty in developing countries. As a result the institutional foundations of these countries are weakened, public funds are misappropriated, and policies and programs aimed at reducing poverty and fostering sustainable economic growth are undermined.^\nIt is therefore not surprising that a 2008 Transparency International report found a direct link between corruption and the failure of the societal institutions designed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in the majority of developing countries. This book investigates the problems of democratic governance, particularly as they relate to corruption, and also whether democracy should be based on universal principles or local context and historical factors. It also analyses the rule of law, in promoting democratic governance and curbing corruption and if governmental, non-governmental organizations, and civil societies are effective in promoting democratic governance and curbing corruption. This book will go beyond identifying the challenges and offer plausible solutions that could be adapted to various developing countries.^\nIt is premised on the importance of bridging theory and practice, which has been lacking in most local and international development publications, making of interest to scholars and policy-makers alike concerned with public administration in developing countries\n

description2024=This article is from Diabetic Foot & Ankle , volume 2 . Abstract Our aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of three different modalities for testing sensory neuropathy in diabetic patients with and without diabetic foot problems. The three devices used included the pin-prick testing using the Neurotip® (PPT), the Semmes–Weinstein 5.07/10 g monofilament testing (SWMT), and the rapid-current perception threshold (R-CPT) measurements using the Neurometer® testing. Our study population consisted of 54 patients (108 feet) with diabetic foot problems treated at the National University Hospital in Singapore by our multi-disciplinary diabetic foot care team. Our results showed no difference in sensory neuropathy detected by PPT and 5.07/10 g SWMT in both the pathological and normal foot. In the pathological foot, there was significant increase in sensory neuropathy detected by the Neurometer® device at both the big toe and ankle sites as compared to PPT and 5.07/10 g SWMT. In the normal foot, there was a significant increase in sensory neuropathy detected by the Neurometer® device at the big toe site only as compared to PPT and 5.07/10 g SWMT. Finally, the Neurometer® measurements detected a statistically higher proportion of feet with sensory neuropathy as compared to detection by the PPT or 5.07/10 g SWMT.

description2023=This article is from BMC Public Health , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is rapidly rising in Asia, but screening uptake remains poor. Although studies have reported gender differences in screening rates, there have been few studies assessing gender specific perceptions and barriers towards CRC screening, based on behavioral frameworks. We applied the Health Belief Model to identify gender-specific predictors of CRC screening in an Asian population. Methods\: A nationwide representative household survey was conducted on 2000 subjects aged 50 years and above in Singapore from 2007 to 2008. Screening behaviour, knowledge and beliefs on CRC screening were assessed by face-to-face structured interviews. The response rate was 88.2%. Results\: 26.7 percent had undergone current CRC screening with no gender difference in rates. Almost all agreed that CRC would lead to suffering (89.8%), death (84.6%) and would pose significant treatment cost and expense (83.1%). The majority (88.5%) agreed that screening aids early detection and cure but only 35.4% felt susceptible to CRC. Nearly three-quarters (74.3%) of the respondents recalled reading or hearing information on CRC in the print or broadcast media. However, only 22.6% were advised by their physicians to undergo screening. Significantly more women than men had feared a positive diagnosis, held embarrassment, pain and risk concerns about colonoscopy and had friends and family members who encouraged screening. On multivariate analysis, screening uptake showed a positive association with worry about contracting CRC and a physician’s recommendation and a negative association with perceived pain about colonoscopy for both genders. For women only, screening was positively associated with having attended a public talk on CRC and having a family member with CRC, and was negatively associated with Malay race and perceived danger of colonoscopy. Conclusions\: CRC screening remains poor despite high levels of awareness of its benefits in this Asian population. Race, worry about contracting cancer, psychological barriers, and cues from the doctor and a public talk on CRC were associated with screening with gender specific differences. Strategies to increase CRC screening uptake should consider gender specific approaches to address psychological barriers and increase disease susceptibility through public health education and active promotion by physicians.

Abstract Background\: In 2001 and 2002, fatal myocarditis resulted in the sudden deaths of four, two adult and two juvenile, orang utans out of a cohort of 26 in the Singapore Zoological Gardens. Methods\: Of the four orang utans that underwent post-mortem examination, virus isolation was performed from the tissue homogenates of the heart and lung obtained from the two juvenile orang utans in Vero cell cultures. The tissue culture fluid was examined using electron microscopy. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction with Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-specific primers targeting the gene regions of VP3/VP1 and 3D polymerase (3Dpol) confirmed the virus genus and species. The two EMCV isolates were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses of the virus genes performed. Serological testing on other animal species in the Singapore Zoological Gardens was also conducted. Results\: Electron microscopy of the two EMCV isolates, designated Sing-M100-02 and Sing-M105-02, revealed spherical viral particles of about 20 to 30 nm, consistent with the size and morphology of members belonging to the family Picornaviridae. In addition, infected-Vero cells showed positive immunoflorescence staining with antiserum to EMCV. Sequencing of the viral genome showed that the two EMCV isolates were 99.9% identical at the nucleotide level, indicating a similar source of origin. When compared with existing EMCV sequences in the VP1 and 3Dpol gene regions, the nucleotide divergence were at a maximum of 38.8% and 23.6% respectively, while the amino acid divergence were at a maximum of 33.9% and 11.3% respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of VP1 and 3Dpol genes further grouped the Sing-M100-02 and Sing-M105-02 isolates to themselves, away from existing EMCV lineages. This strongly suggested that Sing-M100-02 and Sing-M105-02 isolates are highly divergent variants of EMCV. Apart from the two deceased orang utans, a serological survey conducted among other zoo animals showed that a number of other animal species had neutralizing antibodies to Sing-M105-02 isolate, indicating that the EMCV variant has a relatively wide host range. Conclusions\: The etiological agent responsible for the fatal myocarditis cases among two of the four orang utans in the Singapore Zoological Gardens was a highly divergent variant of EMCV. This is the first report of an EMCV infection in Singapore and South East Asia.

description83=This article is from BMC Proceedings , volume 5 . Abstract Expression of CHO mRNA was measured with special microarrays from the Consortium for Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cell Genomics led by Prof. Wei-Shou Hu of the University of Minnesota and Prof. Miranda Yap of the Bioprocess Technology Institute of A*STAR, Singapore(http\://hugroup.cems.umn.edu/CHO/cho_index.html). Cultivation experiments were performed in small scale 2L stirred tank bioreactors. During fermentation a temperature shift of -3°C was performed. This was accompanied by a reduction of the cell specific lactate production rate.The analysis of transcriptome samples before and after the temperature shift with microarrays showed several changes in the expression of available gene markers. LDH-C expression raised about 2 fold after temperature shift. LDH-A did not change. As LDH-C is known to be a specialized isoenzyme in sperm cells for consuming lactate in a lactate containing milieu, LDH-C could be proposed as a target for genetic engineering, facilitating lactate consumption in the late phase of high cell density cultures and prolonging longevity of CHO production cultures by reducing lactate and base accumulation.

Abstract Objective\:\: Statin therapy reduces coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality in individuals with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol below the threshold at which statin therapy is recommended. We determined the proportion of individuals with elevated CRP in whom statin therapy was not indicated, and examined predictors for elevated CRP in a multi-ethnic Asian population. Design\:\: We studied 3404 participants (Chinese, Malays and Asian-Indians) without a history of hypercholesterolemia living in Singapore (mean age±s.d.\: 48.9±11.2 years). Eligibility for statin therapy was determined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII)) guideline. CRP was measured by high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. CRP level greater than 2 mg l−1 was considered as elevated. Results\:\: Elevated CRP was found in 29.3% participants who were not eligible for statin therapy (n\=2974). Elevated CRP was more common in females and amongst those of Malay or Asian-Indian ethnicity. Compared with participants with low CRP, those with elevated CRP were shown to have higher levels of obesity, blood pressure, triglyceride and insulin resistance (IR), but lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (all Ps

description81=This article is from Journal of the Royal Society Interface , volume 9 . Abstract Emerging zoonoses threaten global health, yet the processes by which they emerge are complex and poorly understood. Nipah virus (NiV) is an important threat owing to its broad host and geographical range, high case fatality, potential for human-to-human transmission and lack of effective prevention or therapies. Here, we investigate the origin of the first identified outbreak of NiV encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore. We analyse data on livestock production from the index site (a commercial pig farm in Malaysia) prior to and during the outbreak, on Malaysian agricultural production, and from surveys of NiV's wildlife reservoir (flying foxes). Our analyses suggest that repeated introduction of NiV from wildlife changed infection dynamics in pigs. Initial viral introduction produced an explosive epizootic that drove itself to extinction but primed the population for enzootic persistence upon reintroduction of the virus. The resultant within-farm persistence permitted regional spread and increased the number of human infections. This study refutes an earlier hypothesis that anomalous El Niño Southern Oscillation-related climatic conditions drove emergence and suggests that priming for persistence drove the emergence of a novel zoonotic pathogen. Thus, we provide empirical evidence for a causative mechanism previously proposed as a precursor to widespread infection with H5N1 avian influenza and other emerging pathogens.

The International Institute of Social Studies at Erasmus University Rotterdam spearheaded a project intended to distill and refine the research findings, connecting them to broader literatures and interdisciplinary themes. The book examines commonalities and differences in the operation of various structures of power (gender, class, race/ethnicity, generation) and their interactions within the institutional domains of intra-national and especially inter-national migration that produce context-specific forms of social injustice. Additional contributions have been included so as to cover issues of legal liminality and how the social construction of not only femininity but also masculinity affects all migrants and all women. The resulting set of 19 detailed, interconnected case studies makes a valuable contribution to reorienting our perceptions and values in the discussions and decision-making concerning migration, and to raising awareness of key issues in migrants’ rights.  All chapters were anonymously peer-reviewed.

The analysis showed that early presence was not sustainable and an early Iraqi attack could have inflicted more coalition casualties. This finding prompted Congress to sponsor the Mobility Requirement Study (MRS). This thesis, sponsored by the USAF Studies and Analyses Agency, is an outgrowth of USAF and Joint Staff work for MRS. The thesis develops a multi-period Strategic Airlift Assets Optimization model using linear programming (LP), implemented with the General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS). The model minimizes late deliveries, subject to constraints such as aircraft utilization rate and aircraft handling capacity of an airfield. This thesis demonstrates that such an LP model has sufficiently fast response time to be a viable planning tool in today's political environment, where major regional conflicts can emerge very quickly. The model can lend support to the study of military options at the planning and acquisition stages, as well as enable planners to quickly assess impact of any shortfall in airlift capability\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat Reader\nSingapore Air Force author\n

description2010=An analytical study of Surah al-Kahf of the Qur'an that seeks to explain the reality of a mysterious European Jewish-Christian alliance that is waging unjust war on Islam and oppressing Muslims while pursuing a sinister global agenda on behalf of the Euro-Jewish State of Israel. Khidr said to Moses, Surely you would not be able to show patience with me. Indeed, how can you show patience in respect of that which lies beyond your comprehension (since you can temporarily see with only one eye, and consequently can access only external empirical knowledge)?( SÅ«rah al-Kahf, 18\:66-67) Those like DajjÄl, who see with one eye, can never be patient enough to learn from those like Khidr, who see with two eyes, i.e., the external and the internal. Dajjal's epistemological attack on mankind renders them internally blind and, hence, easily deceived by external appearance while remaining incapable of penetrating internal reality in all that pertains to his mysterious mission. They sometimes lose faith in Allah Most High and become profoundly misguided without being even conscious of such. Nearly always, however, they lack the capacity to understand either the movement of history or the role that Jerusalem and the Holy Land play in the End of History. The Quran declares of such people that they have a status akin to cattle. Praise be to Allah Most High through Whose Kindness Surah al-Kahf and the Modern Age is now published. May He bless this humble work to reach Muslims in many parts of the world. May it assist them to grow closer to the Qur'an and to this Surah - especially every day of Jum'ah when the Surah is to be recited for protection from the Fitnah of Dajjal. May it refresh their memory of the meaning of the Surah and, more importantly, constantly deepen their understanding of the Surah. Amin\! As war on Islam intensifies and the time approaches when the imposter Euro-Jewish State of Israel makes its bid to become the ruling State in the world, and Dajjal the false Messiah would rule the world from Jerusalem and declare that he is the true Messiah, I fear that there would be many who would ban books on the Qur'an. I therefore pray most humbly, and ask my gentle readers to also kindly join in the prayer, that Allah Most High might protect books (such as this humble quartet of books on Surah al-Kahf) that employ the blessed Qur'an to expose those in the godless modern age who are waging unjust war on Islam and Muslims. Amin. A mysterious Euro-world-order with a Jewish-Christian alliance wages war on Islam on behalf of the Euro-Jewish State of Israel. If there is any merit at all in this book it can, perhaps, be located in its role as a very humble pioneering work that might possibly inspire others, more competent than this writer, to a more comprehensive effort in using this Surah of the Qur'an to explain that world today. The first volume of four, containing 'Text Translation and Modern Commentary of Sarah al-Kahf', made its appearance at the same time as this main work on the subject entitled 'Surah al-Kahf and the Modern Age', and was meant to function as a companion volume to this main work. I pray that I might be able to write additional volumes on this subject, Insha Allah, in order to attempt a more comprehensive modern interpretation of the Ahadith and Qur'anic verses dealing (directly and indirectly) with the critically important topics of Dajjal the false Messiah or Anti-Christ, and of Gog and Magog. The writing of the first two books on Surah al-Kahf was kindly sponsored in the names of Rabia Aboobakar Hussein Jakhura and Aboobakar Hussein Jakhura of Malawi in Africa, Abdul Majid Kader Sultan and Fatimah Abdullah of Malaysia, and Hajjah Haniffa Bte Omar Khan Sourattee and Hajjah Mariam Bte Fakir Mohammed of Singapore. May Allah Most Kind bless them all. Amin\! Imran N. Hosein Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia June 2007
description79=This article is from BMC Health Services Research , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: Foreign workers’ migrant status may hinder their utilisation of health services. This study describes the health-seeking behaviour and beliefs of a group of male migrant workers in Singapore and the barriers limiting their access to primary healthcare. Methods\: A cross-sectional study of 525 male migrant workers, ≥21 years old and of Indian, Bangladeshi or Myanmar nationality, was conducted at a dormitory via self-administered questionnaires covering demographics, prevalence of medical conditions and health-seeking behaviours through hypothetical scenarios and personal experience. Results\: 71% (95%CI\: 67 to 75%) of participants did not have or were not aware if they had healthcare insurance. 53% (95%CI\: 48 to 57%) reported ever having had an illness episode while in Singapore, of whom 87% (95%CI\: 82 to 91%) saw a doctor. The number of rest days was significantly associated with higher probability of having consulted a doctor for their last illness episode (p \= 0.026), and higher basic monthly salary was associated with seeing a doctor within 3 days of illness (p \= 0.002). Of those who saw a doctor, 84% (95%CI\: 79 to 89%) responded that they did so because they felt medical care would help them to work better. While 55% (95%CI\: 36 to 73%) said they did not see a doctor because the illness was not serious, those with lower salaries were significantly more likely to cite inadequate finances (55% of those earning 
description78=We so enjoy hearing CEOs say their people are focused on achieving the results the CEO wants. One of our passions is to help more CEOs say this more often. To achieve this, people need to believe the organisation’s goals are clear and attainable, even if stretching. The goals should also be quantified and have clear deadlines where possible. This can be challenging during times of rapid change. Achieving target performance during times of rapid change Many times we hear CEOs say they want their business to change more rapidly. Their high level direction is clear, but the organisation’s more specific goals, milestones and action plans are in flux. Even their organisation’s business model, operating models and organisation structure might be reviewed and changed. A critical challenge is to focus and motivate people to achieve the new goals, while still delivering the necessary financial results. When people change, organisations can change Even with impressive strategic plans, successful business transformation only happens when people change and take action. Motivating people to change and to lead transformation in their areas, can be challenging. Hay Group’s research demonstrates that employee motivation and contribution to achievement of the organisation’s goals are influenced by many factors. Four recommendations to help focus and motivate your people include\: 1. Focus on outcomes Use outcome-oriented goals (rather than activity-oriented goals) to help ensure employees are focused on achieving the most important goals for the organisation. This should encourage employees to review and adapt activity plans, so they implement the most effective combination of activities to achieve the desired outcomes. 2. Create the expectation of transformation Communicate to create understanding and alignment to the transformation. However this is rarely enough to focus people on achieving the new goals. Use performance management to ensure the interests of individuals and the organisation are aligned, and to drive change in behaviour and therefore culture. Used effectively, performance management creates the traction necessary – by shifting peoples understanding of success, creating an understanding that success in their role is determined by their achievement of the new, mutually agreed goals. The performance scorecard should reflect the organisations goals, and be designed to prompt the desired culture change, as well as balance key financial, internal and external measures, and the short and long-term timeframes. 3. Keep key people motivated There is a risk that people might become de-motivated if they think the goal-posts are continually moving and their achievements against old KPIs are not recognised. So leaders should be mindful to recognise what has been achieved, call to account what has not, while ensuring fairness. Leaders should focus on open communication and building alignment to the transformation. It is important to communicate the various development opportunities that business transformation can provide employees, such as learning new capabilities; developing their own career journeys; and sharing in the satisfaction of transforming their organisation to be more successful in the future. 4. Review performance regularly While the progress of the overall business transformation should be reviewed regularly, so too should individual employee performance. Regular discussions with individuals about their performance should make sure that any changes to the business goals are understood and that employee’s performance KPIs are updated collaboratively and are focused on the top priorities for the organisation at all times. These discussions should also recognise achievements, help identify development opportunities and aim to motivate the individual to succeed. When applied well, performance management encourages people to buy into the transformation journey, embrace the new culture as a broader team, and be motivated to achieve the organisation’s goals.

description2002=This article is from Diabetes Care , volume 34 . Abstract OBJECTIVE\: The development of obesity-related metabolic disorders varies with ethnicity. We examined whether ethnicity modifies the relationship between BMI and three metabolic pathways (insulin resistance, inflammation, and adiponectin) that are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\: We analyzed data from 4,804 Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian residents of Singapore with complete data on insulin resistance (IR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and total adiponectin levels. Linear regression models with an interaction term ethnicity*BMI were used to evaluate whether ethnicity modifies the association between BMI and IR, CRP, and adiponectin. RESULTS\: In both uni- and multivariate analyses, BMI was directly associated with IR and CRP and inversely with adiponectin across all ethnic groups. When compared with Chinese and Malays, Asian-Indians had higher IR and CRP and lower adiponectin levels. The associations between BMI and its metabolic pathways were significantly stronger in Chinese than in other ethnic groups. The increase in IR and CRP and the decrease in adiponectin for each unit increase in BMI were greater in Chinese than in other ethnic groups. The findings were similar when waist circumference was used in the analyses instead of BMI. CONCLUSIONS\: The impact of BMI on IR, CRP, and adiponectin appears greater in Chinese as compared with other major Asian ethnic groups. This may partly explain the rapid increase in the prevalence of diabetes and CVD in Chinese populations and highlights the importance of weight management in Asian ethnic groups despite the apparently low levels of obesity.

description2000=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract WHO recommendations for dengue diagnosis require laboratory facilities. Antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have performed poorly, and clinical diagnosis remains the mainstay in dengue-endemic countries. We evaluated a combination antigen-antibody RDT for point-of-care testing in a high-prevalence setting. In this prospective cohort study, adults were enrolled from a tertiary infectious disease centre for evaluation of undifferentiated febrile illness from October 2011 to May 2012. SD Bioline Dengue Duo was evaluated at point-of-care against a WHO-based reference standard of viral isolation, RT-PCR, NS1-, IgM-, and IgG-ELISA. 246 adults were enrolled (median age 34 years, range 18–69), of which 197 could be confirmed definitively as either dengue or non-dengue. DENV-2 was the predominant serotype (79.5%) and the ratio of primary to secondary cases was 1∶1.1. There were no test failures and minimal interobserver variation with a Fleiss’ kappa of 0.983 (95% CI 0.827–1.00). Overall sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% (95% CI 88.8–96.8%) and 92.0% (95% CI 81.2–96.9%) respectively. Using WHO clinical criteria alone for diagnosis had similar sensitivities (95.9%, 95% CI 91.4–98.1%) and lower specificities (20.0%, 95% CI 11.2–33.0%). No significant difference in performance was found when testing early versus late presenters, primary versus secondary cases, or DENV-1 versus DENV-2 infections. The use of a combination RDT fulfills WHO ASSURED criteria for point-of-care testing and can enhance dengue diagnosis in an endemic setting. This has the potential to markedly improve clinical management of dengue in the field.

description62=This article is from Middle East African Journal of Ophthalmology , volume 21 . Abstract To describe three presentations of spitting cobra venom induced ophthalmia in urban Singapore. Case notes and photographs of three patients with venom ophthalmia who presented to our clinic between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed. Two patients encountered the spitting cobra while working at a job site while the third patient had caught the snake and caged it. The venom entered the eyes in all 3 cases. Immediate irrigation with tap water was carried out before presenting to the Accident and Emergency department. All patients were treated medically with topical antibiotic prophylaxis and copious lubricants. The use of anti-venom was not required in any case. All eyes recovered with no long-term sequelae. If irrigation is initiated early, eyes can recover with no significant complications or sequelae.

description57=A selection of papers on Asian population trends and educational development is presented in four parts. Part I defines the major components of Asian population growth as the rapid decline in mortality after 1945, relative increases in the population of less developed regions, accelerated fertility potential, and unequal distribution of wealth. Education is characterized by unequal opportunity and a high dropout rate in primary grades. Part II views rapid population growth as an obstacle to progress and discusses the shortage of capital, the employment dilemma, rising costs of services, social development, and the difficulties of setting educational priorities. Case studies are presented which focus on educational expansion and equality in Japan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Thailand, and Singapore. Part III focuses on rural-urban migration and highlights the problems of this migration with case studies of India, Japan, and Indonesia. Part IV discusses the need for educational innovation and suggests that planners redefine educational objectives more democratically. This section discusses international cooperation in education, radical policies for rural areas, local input into the educational system, and the importance of family planning. A selected bibliography is included. (Author/DB)

description55=This paper discusses the functionalist perspective of stratification and institutional processes of values inculcation in schools and organizations. It is assumed that students' school-to-work transition entail certain differences in life and work expectations as the education system forms the basis of cultural reproduction and values formation. A quantitative study was conducted to investigate the variations in value priorities between managers, professionals and executives in a MNC in Singapore. The questionnaire survey involved 252 participants. The findings highlight that the notion that differences in the relative value preferences between the three hierarchical groups may be a result of their previous respective educational socialization and achievements in schools.

description51=This exploratory study compares key features of the Singapore and U.S. mathematics systems in the primary grades, when students need to build a strong mathematics foundation. It identifies major differences between the mathematics frameworks, textbooks, assessments, and teachers in Singapore and the United States. It also presents initial results from four pilot sites that introduced the Singapore mathematics text book in place of their regular text books. Analysis of these evidentiary streams finds Singaporean students more successful in mathematics than their U.S. counterparts because "Singapore has a world-class mathematics system with quality components aligned to produce students who learn mathematics to mastery." These components include Singapore's highly logical national mathematics framework, mathematically rich problem-based textbooks, challenging mathematics assessments, and highly qualified mathematics teachers whose pedagogy centers on teaching to mastery. Singapore also provides its mathematically slower students with an alternative framework and special assistance from an expert teacher. "The U.S. mathematics system does not have similar features." It lacks a centrally identified core of mathematical content that provides a focus for the rest of the system. Its traditional textbooks emphasize definitions and formulas, not mathematical understanding; its assessments are not especially challenging; and too many U.S. teachers lack sound mathematics preparation. At-risk students often receive special assistance from a teacher's aide who lacks a college degree. As a result, the United States produces students who have learned only to mechanically apply mathematical procedures to solve routine problems and who are, therefore, not mathematically competitive with students in most other industrialized countries.

description46=This is the study of the Malay martial art, silat, and the first ethnographic account of the Haqqani Islamic Sufi Order. Drawing on 12 years of research and practice in Malaysia, Singapore, and England, social anthropologist and martial artist D.S. Farrer considers Malay silat through the Sufi silat group called Seni Silat Haqq, an off-shoot of the Haqqani-Naqshbandi Sufi Order. This account combines theories from the anthropology of art, embodiment, enchantment, and performance to show how war magic and warrior religion amalgamate in traditional Malay martial arts, where practitioners distance themselves from "becoming animal" or going into trance, preferring a practice of spontaneous bodily movement by summoning the power of Allah. Silat and Sufism are revealed through the social dramas of 40-day boot-camps where Malay and European practitioners endeavor to become shadows of the Prophet, only to have their faith tested through a ritual ordeal of boiling oil.

description42=SparksLab Global Venture - According to a post on Andela’s blog, the developer talent accelerator has received more than 10,000 applications in six months. Andela launched six months ago, in September 2014, and has been gaining traction. “Today, we crossed an important milestone” said Jeremy Johnson in the blog post. “Andela has now received over 10,000 applications. The size of our applicant pool is a testament to the fact that word about what we are doing has spread across Nigeria — and beyond. Applications have been received from South Africa, Botswana, Ghana and Kenya, a signal that there is demand for Andela in other parts of the continent.” Andela’s applicant pool has been growing exponentially, and this according to them, shows that they are “tapping into a growing market and a hunger for opportunity”. Andela is said to have an acceptance rate of 0.6%, with the most selective technology training program on the African continent. Jeremy Johnson also said that the company has 100% success rate with clients and 80% of them ask for additional services within the first six months. Andela has shown that their business model is highly effective. Andela currently has a team of over 80 developers and had to move into a new campus to better accommodate them.

With fiscal restructing at home and less unity of purpose among the nations of Asia, the United States is moving to a strategy of 'place not bases' in Southeast Asia. For the strategy to succeed, it is necessary to find like-minded partners in the region who will allow open access to facilities to provide the support needed for the US military to operate globally. The Republic Singapore has been a vocal advocate for a continuing presence of United States forces in the Asia-Pacific. In consonance with its views. Singapore has offered the United States military expanded access to its facilities, agreeing to allow the stationing of a limited number of US military personnel in the Republic. It behooves Us policy planners to understand the views of the Government of Singapore.

description34=This article is from Journal of Carcinogenesis , volume 11 . Abstract Introduction\:\: In this review, the International Agency for Research on Cancer's cancer epidemiology databases were used to examine prostate cancer (PCa) age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) in selected Asian nations, including Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) and GLOBOCAN databases, in an effort to determine whether ASIRs are rising in regions of the world with historically low risk of PCa development. Materials and Methods\:\: Asian nations with adequate data quality were considered for this review. PCa ASIR estimates from CI5 and GLOBOCAN 2008 public use databases were examined in the four eligible countries\: China, Japan, Korea and Singapore. Time trends in PCa ASIRs were examined using CI5 Volumes I-IX. Results\:\: While PCa ASIRs remain much lower in the Asian nations examined than in North America, there is a clear trend of increasing PCa ASIRs in the four countries examined. Conclusion\:\: Efforts to systematically collect cancer incidence data in Asian nations must be expanded. Current CI5 data indicate a rise in PCa ASIR in several populous Asian countries. If these rates continue to rise, it is uncertain whether there will be sufficient resources in place, in terms of trained personnel and infrastructure for medical treatment and continuum of care, to handle the increase in PCa patient volume. The recommendation by some experts to initiate PSA screening in Asian nations could compound a resource shortfall. Obtaining accurate estimates of PCa incidence in these countries is critically important for preparing for a potential shift in the public health burden posed by this disease.

description31=This article is from Indian Journal of Palliative Care , volume 20 . Abstract Despite their proven efficacy and safety, opioid and sedative use for palliation in patients afflicted with cancer in Singapore have been shown to be a fraction of that in other countries. This paper explores the various psychosocial and system-related factors that appear to propagate this conservative approach to care in what is largely a western-influenced care practice. A search for publications relating to sedative and opioid usage in Asia was performed on PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, World Health Organization, and Singapore's government agency websites using search terms such as “opioids,” “sedatives,” “palliation,” “end-of-life-care,” “pain management,” “palliative care,” “cancer pain,” “Asia,” “Singapore,” and “morphine.” Findings were classified into three broad groups – system-related, physician-related, and patient-related factors. A cautious medico-legal climate, shortage of physicians trained in palliative care, and lack of instruments for symptom assessment of patients at the end of life contribute to system-related barriers. Physician-related barriers include delayed access to palliative care due to late referrals, knowledge deficits in non-palliative medicine physicians, and sub-optimal care provided by palliative physicians. Patients' under-reporting of symptoms and fear of addiction, tolerance, and side effects of opioids and sedatives may lead to conservative opioid use in palliative care as well. System-related, physician-related, and patient-related factors play crucial roles in steering the management of palliative patients. Addressing and increasing the awareness of these factors may help ensure patients receive adequate relief and control of distressing symptoms.

description28=This article is from Respiratory Research , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: Levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-creative protein (CRP) indicating systemic inflammation are known to be elevated in chronic diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and depression. Comorbid depression is common in patients with COPD, but no studies have investigated whether proinflammatory cytokines mediate the association between pulmonary function and depressive symptoms in healthy individuals with no known history of obstructive pulmonary diseases. Methods\: In a population-based sample (n \= 2077) of individuals aged 55 and above with no known history of obstructive pulmonary disease in the Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Study (SLAS), we analyzed the relationships between IL-6 and CRP, depressive symptoms (GDS-15 ≥5) and obstructive pulmonary function (FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC% predicted). Results\: High serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were associated with greater prevalence of depressive symptoms (p 
description27=The non‐indigenous Cryptozona siamensis is reported for the first time from Singapore. This terrestrial snail was discovered from the site of a former plant nursery that borders the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and is believed to have been accidentally introduced through horticultural trade activities. Cryptozona siamensis is a potential plant pest and is known to be a host of the parasite that causes human eosinophilic meningitis, a potentially life‐threatening condition. Urgent management to control or eradicate the species is desired to curb its spread. Its distribution and status in Peninsular Malaysia is briefly discussed.
description26=We all know that insurance is essential in our lives and a very good investment too. Life insurance can be used by our family members when we passed on; health insurance is to cover our health emergencies and medical needs.   However, we should also be aware of other personal policies that we can benefit from. We do not know when an accident would happen. It may be at home, at work or while on the road. You can never plan what to do before an accident but you can very well prepare financially for such situations.  Insurance companies such as Axis Capital Group - with a group of companies that branch out from its main office in Bermuda to America, Europe and Singapore - offer personal accident insurance with the assurance to provide for your emergency needs.

description24=In 2012, bevacizumab, a drug which is currently used to cure tumor has been reviewed to have components of chalk. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) immediately sent out warnings to hospitals and clinics of possible the possible taint. It was then found out that for many years, doctors has been prescribing the drug which contains either chalk or cornstarch. In Jakarta, Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand, FDA even found out that there are a number of bevacizumab which has no effective ingredient at all. Three years had passed and there is no exact improvement in fighting off the widespread of counterfeit medicines. The Peterson Group, a non-profit organization campaigning against the proliferation of counterfeit medicines returned to Jakarta to review the status of medicine industry in the city. Although the hospitals and clinics have been more cautious of the supply of medicines coming in and out of their facilities, there are still instances which they cannot assure the distribution of these fraudulent medicines in drug stores and markets. The control may not already be in their hands but on the legal action taken by the manufacturers themselves. Pfizer, Sanofi and other large companies are doing their own investigations on the deadly medicines. They reason out that other mediocre manufacturers may not have the proper tools to tag their own products let alone make their own move against counterfeiting. Technologies which have the capability to trace, scan and analyze a product are still costly which a lot of manufactures cannot procure. The end result may lead to total foreclosure because of the fall of business.  Large companies are lucky enough to have the means for a total and more focused analysis on the competitive counterfeit products. However, they face a different dilemma and conflict with the local government they are working with. The investigations may not be totally transparent since the public power itself has strict political agenda that may hinder the cause.  The following are the key factors that make the campaign against counterfeiting incongruous with the authorities\: 1. Inadequate Legislation and enforcement Albeit the pure cause and the high probability of crime, some nations have lax security system and inadequate, sometimes vague legislations regarding counterfeiting. Counterfeiters may sometimes have a low risk of punishment 2. Insufficient Penal Sanctions Despite the best efforts of manufacturers to take into custody, perhaps put in life imprisonment, those who are involved in these fraudulent acts, the penalty system for counterfeiting may be too sloppy to be feared.  3. Lack of awareness among health professionals and consumers Civilians and other individuals may not have any tools or proper education system to detect and determine counterfeited medicines.

Telugu is the third most spoken language in the Indian subcontinent after Hindi and Bengali. Telugu is one of the 22 official languages of India. It was declared the official language of Andhra Pradesh when the state was formed on 1st Nov 1956 on linguistic basis. Telugu also has official language status in the Yanam District of the Union Territory of Pondicherry. This is the 1860 New Testament in Telegu (Telugu) Language from India.

description19=This article is from BMC Infectious Diseases , volume 11 . Abstract Background\: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has caused recurrent epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease among children in Singapore. Between August 2008 and July 2010, we conducted a survey to estimate the seroprevalence of EV71 infection among children and adolescents aged 1-17 years. We compared our EV71 seroepidemiologic findings with a previous study conducted in 1996-1997. Methods\: The survey involved the prospective collection of 1,200 residual sera from Singapore residents aged 1-17 years in two hospitals. Neutralizing antibodies to EV71 were detected by the microneutralization test. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of EV71 antibodies and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and compared by age groups. Statistical significance was taken as P < 0.05. Results\: The overall EV71 antibody prevalence was 26.9% (95% CI\: 24.5-29.5%). It increased significantly from 14.3% in children aged 1-6 years to 27.8% in those aged 7-12 years, and reached 38.8% in adolescents aged 13-17 years. The seroconversion rate differed by about 12% between the consecutive age groups. The GMT of EV71 antibodies was higher among primary school children aged 7-12 years in our study than that among the 6-12 year age group in the 1996-1997 study. Conclusions\: Higher antibody titers were observed in children aged 1-6 years than those in the other two age groups, indicating that most of the infections had been acquired during early childhood. EV71 infection is common among children and adolescents in Singapore, with 39% infected by the time they are in secondary school (13-17 years of age).

description15=Komentari Eksegesis oleh Dr Bob Utley, pensiunan Guru Besar Penafsiran Alkitab. Ditulis dalam bentuk panduan belajar. Revelation is one of the most difficult books to interpret. We must be careful not to be dogmatic in our interpretation because godly people throughout history have disagreed on its meaning. It is a uniquely Jewish literary genre, apocalyptic, which was often used in tension-filled times to express the conviction that God was in control of history and would bring deliverance to His people. The author is believed to be the Apostle John. The setting was persecution caused by the separation of the local churches from the legal protection Rome accorded to Judaism. Revelation was written to show God's sovereignty in history and the promise of the culmination of all things in Him. Christians are to remain faithful even amidst persecution, always remembering the blessed hope.

Die Biene-Kolonie ist das beste Beispiel, was, das wir Ihnen präsentieren können. Jede Biene ist ein perfekter Träger der Kolonie Kultur. Es unterhält die optimale Effizienz in Bezug auf die Jagd und Ernte Honig. Jede Biene hat nicht nur die Fähigkeit zu riechen, Nektar-schwere Blüten, es hat auch die Fähigkeiten zur Unterstützung von anderen Bienen, ineffiziente Bewegungen zu vermeiden. Wir wissen jetzt, dass eine Biene nach der Ernte Nektar aus einer bestimmten Blume, markiert, der als bereits leer durch einen Duft es Blätter, Blume, warnen andere, es zu umgehen. Daher, wahre Professionalität, kann Arbeitnehmer die besten Kunden zu riechen und anderen mitteilen, dass die schlechte Kunden um und müssen vermieden werden. Es geht auch mit möglichen schlechten Entscheidungen oder schlechte Investitionsentscheidungen, die auf dem Weg gefunden werden können. Solche Fähigkeiten durch Ausbildung erworben werden können, müssen wir zugeben. Aber es braucht zusätzliche Leidenschaft, nicht nur training, das Niveau der Fähigkeit zu entwickeln, die erlaubt, Menschen größere Herausforderungen überwinden und intensivere Risiken zu akzeptieren dass, um höhere Ziele nicht normalerweise von anderen Personen getroffen. Es ist die zusätzlichen Vorteil an innovativen und unternehmerischen Kraft, die das beste vom guten bestimmt. Echte Professionalität ist des Herzens, nicht nur des Geistes. Verstehen, wie das Herz funktioniert und du erhältst die Kante über diejenigen, die lediglich zu unterrichten. Warum? Weil das Herz tiefer Pflege und mehr Phantasie, nicht nur bloße wissen und Routine erfordert. Aztec versteht den Weg zu einem erfolgreichen Unternehmen. Menschen wichtig und sie müssen erkannt und entsprechend belohnt werden. Aber wer wirklich professionelle Herzstück sind, kommt die Entschädigung vor der Lohn. Die Herausforderung der Arbeit, das tun der Arbeit und der Abschluss der Arbeiten sind ein und dasselbe. Wie der Jäger, der riecht und hört die töten, noch bevor es gesehen wird, kommt die Abenteuer und die Freude, etwas zu tun mit das tun selbst. Jeder, der sein Bestes tut wird belohnt durch gemacht haben, was getan werden muss, sowie das konkrete Material Gewinne erworben. Aber das Herz, das schon vorher das Ergebnis kennt ist bei Frieden und Gehalt schon vor der eigentlichen Ausführung. Das ist echte und außergewöhnliche Professionalität.

description872=In recent years, Singapore has emerged as a major hub of international education in South East Asia. The innovations in Singapore were motivated by a need to prepare the students to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It can be easily seen that globalisation and intensifying economic competition were the driving forces behind most of these innovations. For a number of countries in Asia, Singapore education today stands as a model that they could follow and perhaps emulate. Two questions however need exploration\: Is there a singular model of Singapore educational success? If yes, what are the essential elements of such a model? This review paper tries to address these questions by building a conceptual model of Singapore Education that could be applied to the education of young adults in developing countries. The study focuses on qualitative (Verbal) and Quantitative reasoning processes, since these processes (and their combinations in various patterns) may lie at the foundation of various education programmes.

description871=I was asked to fly to Hong Kong in DEC 2002 from where I was working in Stockholm to check for my Cdn EDS Consulting company boss on a problem with a contract there- fresh unbiased eyes. So off to to Amsterdam and a direct flight over Mother Russia to Hong Kong. Lasnded in the equivalent of "downtown Hong Kong " at Kai Tak airport -which was in Hong Kong harbour- one landed literally over the city. On final approach I could see laundry hanging out of apartments lining the runway. Sure hope the pilots got extra pay for a HK landing\!\\ This resulted in me going back to Canada and making a report.This also resulted in me being sent back to Hong Kong to work on rather disjointed project.  At this time Hong Kong under British rule - policemen were impecacable with lots of British police NCOs who spoke fluent Mandarin. The whole city was thriving -but the Britisih mandate was up. Jan was with me and we had a great time in this fascinating city- with me working and Jan shopping. We stayed at New World Apts in Kowloon -right on the waterfront with a view of Hong Kong-  a fascinating scene at night across the water . Kowloon had a boardwalk all the way from the hotel to the ferry terminal and we walked it every night. Then I had a better offer in Australia in 2003 and off to Australia I went with Jan. Almost sorry - I would go back to HK tomorrow I went from my job or assignment in Australia after - what - a year/- to Singapore - always with Jan. The Singapore assignment gave me a regular visits on business to Hong Kong.I immediately saw the change with mainland China taking over. Fewer English being spoken - pro democracy demonstrations.  But the yearly horse race went on and it will take a long time to "change" Hong Kong

description866=Although Thai financial institutions have seemingly weathered the current global economics storm, many highly paid professionals, especially in the fixed-income sector of international financial institutions, haven’t been so lucky. During the past six months financial institutions that sold fixed-income derivative instruments have laid off people all over the region, including Thailand. The Nation has learned that in addition to failed investment banks Lehman Bros and Bear Stearns, financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered Bank. Citigroup and Deutsche Bank have laid off many highly paid bankers in South Eas6t Asia since the global economic crisis exploded in late September. In Hong Kong, many bankers with children were sent home right after Christmas and international school wait lists have dwindled down to almost zero. Here in Thailand, the redundancies of highly paid fixed-income finance professionals have created a crisis in that employment sector. But many Thai “Main Street” businesses are seeing it as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to hire much-needed finance professionals. “Large Thai public and private companies are now fighting to get these top finance professionals on board,” said Edwin Sim, CEO of Human Capital Alliance . Sim said that normally highly paid finance professionals with as much as a decade or more of experience working for top international banks would be hesitant about joining large local companies. Although the world economies are currently going through a rough patch, Sim said that most large Thai company operators believe that globalization will continue when economies inevitably recover. “They realize that to operate successfully and sustainably in the coming decade all companies must be able to develop efficient capital structure that will allow them to compete globally,” he said. These capital structures, Sim said, require the expertise of finance professionals that have honed their skills with the world’s top financial institutions. “Thai companies realize that the current economic crisis has created a “perfect storm” for them to attract individual high level financial professional with these unique skills,” he said. At the same time, many of these experienced finance professionals, Sim said, are now finally able to get off a decade-long financial institution wage-bubble that made many of them “hostage” to their jobs, with work weeks that often surpassed 60 to 70 hours. “The money was great and many were willing to sacrifice their quality of life,” he said. However, the current global economic crisis is forcing many finance institution professionals to rethink their futures. “Many firmly believe that the Thai economy is on the cusp of being one of the region’s most dynamic economies. They want to get on board now and reap the benefits by helping Thai companies become global players,” he said. During the past decade, Sim says, many Thai companies strengthened their corporate governance and risk-management initiatives as a result of the 1997 Asian crisis. Consequently, they have much more sustainable operating platforms, which closely follow international standards. “Top finance company professionals are now attracted because they can see that many companies are now adopting corporate strategies that include sustainability as a core issue,” he said. These companies, Sim adds, now have a much broader understanding of the industrial system in which they operate, including a broad range of relevant factor, trends, forces and interactions. “Thai companies now are willing to pay for high quality people with a deep system-based understanding of how the global economy, environment, society and geopolitics interact and affect organizations,” he said. Perhaps, just as importantly, Sim said, many Thai companies are now in a position where they can accommodate these professionals’ compensation and lifestyle requirements.

description865=Out of the 38 nations studied in the 1999 "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMSS), children in Singapore scored highest in mathematics (National Center for Education Statistics, NCES, 2003). Why do Singapore's children do so well in mathematics? The reasons are undoubtedly complex and involve social aspects. However, the mathematics texts used in Singapore present some interesting, accessible problem- solving methods, which help children solve problems in ways that are sensible and intuitive. Could the texts used in Singapore be a significant factor in children's mathematics achievement? There are some reasons to believe so. In this article, I give reasons for studying the way mathematics is presented in the elementary mathematics texts used in Singapore; show some of the mathematics problems presented in these texts and the simple diagrams that accompany these problems as sense-making aids; and present data from TIMSS indicating that children in Singapore are proficient problem solvers who far outperform U.S. children in problem-solving.

description860=Applying variation-correlation method to images of fractography obtained from the scanning electron microscope (SEM), it has been found that there exists a fractal characteristic length within which the fractured surfaces are fractal. Investigation shows that the fractal characteristic length can represent the statistical maximum size of texture of the SEM image. Multi-magnification fractal analysis has shown that fractography cannot be described by a single fractal dimension but rather a series of fractal dimensions. Fractal study on the fractured surfaces of gray iron with different grain size has shown that there exists a positive relationship between tensile strength and fractal dimension. However, no essential relationship between impact toughness and fractal dimension for HP26Cr35Ni alloy could be obtained. Fractal dimension is sensitive to changes of mechanical properties caused by geometric factors such as grain size and is suitable to quantitatively describe the irregularity of fractography. For a given fracture mode, fractal dimension is not universal.

description858=The paper's hypothesis is that higher education has universal value, but is seen as serving different primary purposes in different societies and political contexts. In Part I of the study, 18 professors from 12 countries were interviewed; the 12 countries were England, Spain, Yugoslavia, Soviet Union, Turkey, India, Malaysia, Philippines, China (PRC), Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. In Part II, professors from Kuwait, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, England, Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia were interviewed. Findings are analyzed in terms of the academic structure of higher education, the purpose of systems of higher education, the role of professors in universities, the role of teaching, the concept of "good teaching," incentives and rewards for good teaching, teaching styles and interaction between professor and students, evaluation of learning, and faculty development. It is concluded that higher education has universal value, but teaching receives low priority in elite institutions around the world, where the norm suggests that students are privileged to attend. Universities with more open access, however, try to attract a broad range of students to higher education and attach increased importance to the quality of teaching to meet these goals.

Bennington An investigation has been made, from the "fading" data in the reception log-sheets received from Singapore and Johannesburg, of the incidence of the tropical sunset fading effect at those places during the period from local sunset to five hours thereafter, for the equinoctial months of the years 1953 to 1958. At Singapore the effect was of little consequence during sunspot minimum years, but from 1955 to 1958 it became increasingly noticeable as the sunspot number increased towards maximum. At Johannesburg, on the other hand, it was present even during sunspot minimum years, though its incidence increased considerably from 1955 to 1958. At Singapore, during the years when it was present, medium-rapid or worse types of fading set in at local ground sunset and increased to incidence rates of up to 95% of the total hourly observations one or two hours after sunset, thereafter decreasing to a negligible incidence rate four to five hours after sunset. At Johnannesburg the diurnal time pattern was different, and the fading did not generally start until two hours after local ground sunset, thereafter increasing sharply to incidence rates near 80% of the total hourly observations at four hours after sunset, and maintaining a high incidence rate until reporting ceased, five hours after sunset.

description852=Wie definieren wir Kundendienst, damit wir wissen können, was es ist und was es dauern wird, um es auf einem Niveau bieten, die konsequent als auch finanzierbar sein wird? Dies mag wie eine schwierige Frage für jeden zu Fragen, vor allem, wenn man nicht die Erfolgsbilanz vorzuweisen. Aber Norvell and Associates verfügt über die Erfahrung und Glaubwürdigkeit einige Tipps zur Verbesserung eines Unternehmens. Hier sind die Tipps, wie Sie die erforderlichen Mitarbeiterfähigkeiten für exzellenten Kundenservice zu entwickeln\: 1. gut, wenn nicht einwandfreie, Kommunikationsfähigkeit Kundendienst kommuniziert vor allem mit Kunden, ob verbal oder nicht. Ein Lächeln ist oft der beste erste Ausdruck setzen Sie an Ihre Kunden vor den Worten 100 oder so heraus, was Sie sagen. Umgekehrt ist ein Stirnrunzeln das Mörder-Wort für jede Transaktion mit Menschen. Ihre Kunden sich wohl gestellt, versichern Ihnen dann sie haben Sie ihr Interesse daran mit wenigen Worten, wie "Wie kann ich Sie, Madam/Sir helfen?" Oder gehen direkt auf den Punkt und Fragen zu klären und Definieren von Bedingungen und Richtlinien, die sie nicht vollständig verstehen können. Das Lächeln lässt natürlich nie das Gesicht; Es ist eine ständige Qualitätssicherung, dass was der Kunde hört und sieht echt und bedeutete, ihre Zweifel und Ängste zu zerstreuen. Ohne diese wichtige Fähigkeit, eine Menge Probleme bleiben ungelöst und zu mehr Problemen führen. 2. zuhören können Menschen können mit Ohren geboren worden zu sein; aber das garantiert nicht, dass sie wissen, wie man zuhört. Oder wenn sie wissen, wie, sie haben nicht wirklich die Fähigkeiten, um alles zu verarbeiten, sie nach der anderen Person Sicht hören. Daher gibt es wirksame hören hat zwei Aspekte\: die Worte und der Sinn der Worte. Wir alle kennen die Bedeutungen der Wörter, im Allgemeinen. Für technisches Vokabular benötigen wir ein Wörterbuch oder einen Verweis definieren, worüber wir sprechen. Vergangenheit gegangen, haben wir gehen so weit zu verstehen, wie die andere Person ein bestimmtes Wort verwendet wird. Oft hilft haben ein Notebook oder ein Tablet, wesentliche Punkte während des Gesprächs aufzuschreiben Fragen im Kopf und im Kopf des Kunden zu klären. Wenn Grafiken, Zeichnungen oder Flussdiagramme erforderlich sind, werden Hinweise und visuelle Hilfsmittel um Probleme zu beheben nützlich sein. Es ist einfacher zu hören, wenn Sie Wörter mit Illustrationen Partnerschaft sind, um Verwirrung oder Missverständnisse zu vermeiden. Aber auch die buntesten Fotos oder Grafiken möglicherweise nicht genug, um den Punkt ankommt – sprechen Sie über die im Zusammenhang mit der Eigenschaft Grenzlinien. Es möglicherweise erforderlich, bei Menschen mit das Know-how oder die Behörde entscheiden, bestimmte Probleme zu bringen. Im Allgemeinen erfordert Umgang mit Kunden nicht allerdings eine richterliche oder mieten einen Anwalt um zu begleichen. Das Hauptziel ist es, zu Gunsten des Kunden, so weit wie möglich zu lösen. Der Schlüssel ist dann mit dem Kunden Interesse immer als der wichtigste Aspekt zu hören. 3. Produkt-Knowhow Ob Sie Bücher, Smartphones oder Pizza verkaufen, ist Produktwissen eine wesentliche Voraussetzung bei der Bereitstellung von Kundenzufriedenheit. Zu wissen, wie ein Produkt funktioniert--zum Beispiel wird eine neue Telefonfunktion, die Telekonferenzen – ermöglicht, zu einem Produkte Reiz und die Verkäuflichkeit hinzugefügt. Mehr noch, muss wenn ein Problem mit der Produktfunktion entsteht oder der Crustiness eine Pizza für Stammkunden inkonsistent ist, Angestellter wissen, die Lösungen für das Problem. Sofortiges Feedback zu geben, der Gesellschaft oder an andere Mitarbeiter ist ein Hauptmechanismus für jede Organisation. Produktkenntnisse muss Hand in Hand gehen mit Verfahrens- oder Management-Fähigkeiten im Umgang mit Kunden sorgen. 4. Ausdauer Umgang mit Kunden kann eine stressige und mühsame Aufgabe sein. In der Nähe der schließen-Stunden des Arbeitstages, können Kunden sein gereizt und auch ungeduldig mit Mitarbeitern, die ebenfalls müde und launisch. Es ist bei solchen Begegnungen Crunch-Time, dass Kommunikation oft bricht und Transaktionen fehlschlagen. Die alten 20 % Trefferquote von kalt-Akquisition Verkaufsgespräche können weiterhin auch in andere Formen der Kundenbetreuung Situationen angewendet. Aber das ist nur der Fall, wo der Mitarbeiter die Ausdauer hat, um alle notwendigen Werkzeuge und Fähigkeiten, um einen Verkauf zu schließen oder auf vollständige und exzellenten Service gleichermaßen für alle Kunden gelten. Es ist wie das einfache Prinzip Konfuzius lehrte seinen Jüngern über seinen ersten Job als junger Mann, das war einfach und leicht durchführbar\: alles er tun musste, war, das Gewicht oder das Volumen zu messen oder Reis richtig und an den Käufer übergeben. Solange er es richtig jedes Mal gemacht haben, hat er erfüllt, was von ihm verlangt wurde. In den meisten Fällen Angestellter tun muss, ist seine Arbeit anwenden, sorgfältig und so vollständig wie er oder sie sollte und, dass genügend Kundenservice vorsehen. Das erfordert Ausdauer. Aber wenn Probleme auftreten, das ist, wo die zusätzliche Kenntnisse und die außergewöhnliche Geduld an die Front gerufen werden. 5. Wesen positiv zu allen Zeiten Das Leben ist voller harter Arbeit und Kampf, die dazu führen, dass selbst die schwungvolle von Individuen zu stöhnen oder beschweren. Aber vor Kunden, nicht emotionale Ehrlichkeit ein hilfreiches Werkzeug, sondern vielmehr ein Abschreckungsmittel zu Kunden-Firma Beziehungen. Mitarbeiter können den Trick der verbleibenden positiven in erster Linie durch den Einsatz von positiver Sprache lernen. Anstatt negative Worte ("Wir können Ihr Gerät nicht reparieren..." "Oder"man können keinen Ersatz... bekommt"), sie können die Anweisung rund um sie zu positiven ("Wir müssen Ihr Gerät ersetzt oder repariert, oder wenn...") aktivieren. Ja, dauert es einen glücklichen Mensch, eine andere Person glücklich zu machen. Komödien nutzen die Situation, wo die unglückliche oder unzufriedene Person vorgibt, schwimmfähig oder unberührt zu sein. Aber selten wird es heraus als lustig wenn du unglücklich bist und Sie befassen sich mit Kunden, die auch unglücklich sein könnten. Anders als in Mathematik werden zwei negative nur in mehr Negativität vervielfachen. Ein positiver Mitarbeiter hat eine größere Chance für Zufriedenheit auf der beschwerdeführenden Kunden als ein negativ-Mitarbeiter. Die Sonne bleibt hell und heiß, noch hinter den Wolken. Und also, selbst wenn Gesichter bedeckt betrachten, eine positive Einstellung bleibt so mächtig wie der unbesiegbaren Sonne.

description849=The intent of this study is to explore how WAP (wireless application protocol) technology mediates online discussions. The focus of this research is on the implications of WAP technology for online discussions, and the types of discussion topics that are most suitable for WAP-based discussions and the finding of the combination of WAP- and WEB-based discussions. Multiple methods of inquiry were employed in this study. A survey, face-to-face interviews, and focus group interviews were conducted to find out participants' perceptions of using the WAP-enabled mobile phone as a communication tool, and how such a tool has facilitated or impeded their learning processes technically and cognitively. A content analysis was made on the postings generated from WAP- and WEB-based forums. This study is one of the very first attempts at investigating the use of WAP-enabled mobile phones for online discussions in one of the higher education institutions in Singapore. By exploring the potential of this newly developed technology, this study can provide guidelines to educators as they reflect on the way online discussions can be integrated into a course and lay a foundation for future development of a mobile online learning environment.

description846=In Thailand, as in other Asian countries, expatriate managers should be aware of the dangers of becoming too deeply rooted in the local working culture . Hired for their “international skills,” foreign executives usually expect a spell in a country like Thailand simply to broaden their experience and add sparkle to their CVs. What they do not imagine is that the host country might dull their ambition, alter their managing style, and even tie them down. Yet this happens regularly, and sometimes a promising international career is derailed. Razor-keen MBAs soon find themselves questioning their own logic, checking aggressive instincts and opting for, in Thailand’s case, the softer local style. The victim may not realize what is happening until it is too late. He or she likes the place and decides, to get beneath the skin of the culture. Time passes and he or she is no longer the bright newcomer bubbling with the latest ideas from abroad. Soon they find themselves accepting a smaller expatriate package of benefits; then they discover they must compete for jobs with cheaper local talent who, ironically, easily trump their knowledge of the country. “My strong advice is to be very careful about spending too long in a place like Thailand. You can be trapped,” says Edwin Sim, managing director of Human Capital Alliance , a Bangkok consultancy. “It takes only two or three years for multinationals to set up a business platform in a country; after that local professionals can run it. In my last nine years recruiting in Thailand 99 per cent of my clients were looking for locals,” adds Mr.Sim. Until the 1997 crash Thailand was a hot emerging market that regularly reported double-digit growth, so there were reasons for supposing that Thai-specific knowledge would be valued. Executives who have made that gamble may now wish they had opted to become experts in China, which is shaping up to be a global giant on all counts. Thailand is pleasant but its economy frightens no one. Managers who succeed in Thailand are often those who have been able to adapt themselves to a complex culture where confrontation is frowned upon, where powerful vested interests must be carefully navigated and where a lack of boldness in employees must be overlooked. Yet these conscientious people may find, when they finally look up, that they have lost the will, or the ability, to engage in the rougher entrepreneurial environment of more important business centres. “The career books are full of glib advice about moving around. The reality is different. Real people do click with a culture, do have ambition sucked out of them,” says George Morgan, former head of the foreign stockbrokers’ association in Thailand and now an independent analyst and investor. “Companies all over the world also like to bring in young blood that is cheaper, hungrier and more willing. The consequences for the expat can be drastic. It may be more difficult to slide sideways in an alien environment,” he says. Expats who have chosen to work in Thailand appear united in thinking nothing wrong with choosing a less glittering career path as the price of shunning international mobility. “If working in completely different culture doesn’t change you then I’d say it was a complete waste of time coming,” says David Lyman, chairman of Tilleke & Gibbins, a large independent Thai law firm. “If you stay long enough you find that when you go home everything seems duller. Your friends seem more provincial. Suddenly you miss your new home,” says this American citizen who has not worked in the US for four decades. What everyone who has worked in Asia seems to agree upon is that even in a world of ever-increasing surface uniformity the region remains difficult to understand. Yet even executives who step outside the expat bubble to try to explore their territory will not be saved if their performance does not match their local knowledge. Lots of foreign managers lost their jobs in Thailand last year, according to Anthony Ainsworth of headhunter Richard Glynn\: “There are lots of manager out there on fat expat package riding on thin profit margins. They are very vulnerable when cost-cutting time comes around.” Ultimately, every executive will be judged by results and any management style will be acceptable if it is in the company’s favour, says Mr. Ainsworth. An “international” career can be partially protected by not surrendering to destructive local ways. “Executives should fight like hell for their own values and standards. Different should not mean worse,” he says. Age is a factor. Younger, less encumbered executives appear less prone to being trapped than middle-aged managers who have already tasted something of what the world has to offer and may be tempted to extend their stay. Location is also important. Executives in busy centres such as Hong Kong or Singapore are less likely to fear that their value in the job market is sliding. But executives of any age will find themselves affected by an exotic new environment. American consultancy Revel Miller found that 40 per cent of repatriated managers left the parent company within three years because they struggled to reintegrate or were frustrated over a lack of recognition. Individual managers can protect themselves by keeping good communications with their parent company. To be on the safe side experts advise ambitious executives to restrain foreign work tours to two or three years at a time and keep a beady eye on their ultimate objective. If they expect to do their most important work in London then they should spend more time there or in similar centres rather than in Thailand. Human Capital Alliance’s Mr. Sim said\: “The secret is knowing where you want to be ultimately and to work backwards. Choosing a soft lifestyle with an Asian flavour is fine if this is really where you want to end up.”
description845=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Objectives\: HIV-1 viral quantitation is essential for treatment monitoring. An in-house assay would decrease financial barriers to access. Materials and Methods\: A real-time competitive RT-PCR in house assay (Sing-IH) was developed in Singapore. Using HXB2 as reference, the assay's primers and probes were designed to generate a 183-bp product that overlaps a portion of the LTR region and gag region. A competitive internal control (IC) was included in each assay to monitor false negative results due to inhibition or human error. Clinical evaluation was performed on 249 HIV-1 positive patient samples in comparison with the commercially available Generic HIV Viral Load assay. Correlation and agreement of results were assessed for plasma HIV-1 quantification with both assays. Results\: The assay has a lower limit of detection equivalent to 126 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA and a linear range of detection from 100–1000000 copies/mL. Comparative analysis with reference to the Generic assay demonstrated good agreement between both assays with a mean difference of 0.22 log10 copies/mL and 98.8% of values within 1 log10 copies/mL range. Furthermore, the Sing-IH assay can quantify HIV-1 group M subtypes A–H and group N isolates adequately, making it highly suitable for our region, where subtype B and CRF01_AE predominate. Conclusions\: With a significantly lower running cost compared to commercially available assays, the broadly sensitive Sing-IH assay could help to overcome the cost barriers and serve as a useful addition to the currently limited HIV viral load assay options for resource-limited settings.

description843=Singapore primary and secondary school teachers (n\=76) attending an inservice education course on motivating learners identified and described two critical lessons\: one in which the teachers successfully motivated students and another in which they failed to motivate pupils. Participants recalled those critical lessons in a reflective and self-evaluative manner. Each lesson was analyzed by an assigned "critic" and discussed by the group. Analysis of the lessons revealed that primary school teachers felt that "pupil involvement" and "tuning in" were most frequently successful in motivating pupils to learn. Among secondary school teachers, "teacher being prepared,""topic relevance," and "teacher concern/awareness of needs" were contributing factors. At the primary level, commonly cited reasons for motivation failure were "teacher doing the usual" and "no tuning in." At the secondary level, the most frequently reported cause was "teacher being unprepared." Being able to motivate learning was felt to result from "knowledge of, concern, and love for children"; "teacher attributes"; "effort and preparation"; "lively lessons"; and "teacher awareness of learning needs."

description841=This paper reports principally on two studies, prompted by research on school effectiveness in the United States and England, which indicate globalization is beginning to affect school improvement. The first study cites case studies of two schools--from working-class, multi-ethnic, poorly educated areas of Singapore and London--to determine if these schools can be validly compared, and if so, to point out how these schools can learn from each other. School improvement began when the school acquired a new, enthusiastic head teacher who believed everyone capable of learning, and who infused staff and students with this ideal. The second study questioned whether student groupings could make a difference in certain areas. Three separate groups of 15 schools were selected to determine any differences in student levels of self-esteem, staff attitudes to groups, and academic progress. It appears that ability groupings do not have a strong or uniform impact on pupil progress. (Contains 35 references.) (DFR)
description840=As Jim Cramer of CNBC's Mad Money always says\: "There's always a bull market somewhere." In the spirit of that bullish way of viewing markets in both good and not-so-good times, here are 10 investment ideas that panelists from USA TODAY's 2016 Investment Roundtable say can help you build a winning portfolio in 2016. 1. FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL STOCKS. If David Kostin of Goldman Sachs is right and the broad S&P 500 stock index posts flat returns next year, owning an index fund that tracks and mimics the performance of the large-company stock gauge may not be the most profitable strategy. To increase your odds of posting double-digit percentage gains next year, pinpoint individual names that have what it takes to outperform the S&P 500. "Stock picking will become much more important," says Kostin, who favors growth stocks with strong balance sheets and companies that the bulk of their revenues domestically.

description838=This article is from BMC Infectious Diseases , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: Schools are important foci of influenza transmission and potential targets for surveillance and interventions. We compared several school-based influenza monitoring systems with clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance, and assessed the variation in illness rates between and within schools. Methods\: During the initial wave of pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) infections from June to Sept 2009 in Singapore, we collected data on nation-wide laboratory confirmed cases (Sch-LCC) and daily temperature monitoring (Sch-DTM), and teacher-led febrile respiratory illness reporting in 6 sentinel schools (Sch-FRI). Comparisons were made against age-stratified clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) data from 23 primary care clinics (GP-ILI) and proportions of ILI testing positive for pdmH1N1 (Lab-ILI) by computing the fraction of cumulative incidence occurring by epidemiological week 30 (when GP-ILI incidence peaked); and cumulative incidence rates between school-based indicators and sero-epidemiological pdmH1N1 incidence (estimated from changes in prevalence of A/California/7/2009 H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition titers ≥ 40 between pre-epidemic and post-epidemic sera). Variation in Sch-FRI rates in the 6 schools was also investigated through a Bayesian hierarchical model. Results\: By week 30, for primary and secondary school children respectively, 63% and 79% of incidence for Sch-LCC had occurred, compared with 50% and 52% for GP-ILI data, and 48% and 53% for Sch-FRI. There were 1,187 notified cases and 7,588 episodes in the Sch-LCC and Sch-DTM systems; given school enrollment of 485,723 children, this represented 0.24 cases and 1.6 episodes per 100 children respectively. Mean Sch-FRI rate was 28.8 per 100 children (95% CI\: 27.7 to 29.9) in the 6 schools. We estimate from serology that 41.8% (95% CI\: 30.2% to 55.9%) of primary and 43.2% (95% CI\: 28.2% to 60.8%) of secondary school-aged children were infected. Sch-FRI rates were similar across the 6 schools (23 to 34 episodes per 100 children), but there was widespread variation by classrooms; in the hierarchical model, omitting age and school effects was inconsequential but neglecting classroom level effects led to highly significant reductions in goodness of fit. Conclusions\: Epidemic curves from Sch-FRI were comparable to GP-ILI data, and Sch-FRI detected substantially more infections than Sch-LCC and Sch-DTM. Variability in classroom attack rates suggests localized class-room transmission.

description837=A 1/6-full-size model of the hull of the British Singapore IIC flying boat was tested in the NACA tank. The results are given in the form of charts and are compared with the results of previous tests made in the NACA tank of a 1/12-full-size model, published in NACA T.N. No. 580, and with the results of tests made in the British R.A.E. tank of another 1/6-full-size model of the same hull. When the data from the tests of the 1/6- and 1/12-full-size models were compared on the basis of Froude's law of comparison, differences were found. This fact supported the belief that the small scale of the model and the use of a model that was too small to suit the equipment of the NACA tank had caused the results of the tests of the 1/12-full-size model to be less reliable than the results of the tests of the 1/6-full-size model. The results of the tests of the two models agreed sufficiently well to show that test of a small model, if made meticulously and with suitable equipment, may give useable results, but that a larger model should be used whenever feasible. The results of the NACA tests of the 1/6-full-size model were found to be in good agreement with the R.A.E. tests of a model of the same size.

description834=Background\: Solving ill-structured problems is an important aspect in many professions, including the teaching profession. It is therefore appropriate to engage pre-service teachers in solving ill-structured problems. Aim\: This study investigates the ill-structured problem-solving processes in an un-moderated asynchronous discussion for one group of pre-service teachers in Singapore. Sample\: 21 pre-service teachers taking a post-graduate diploma teacher preparation course at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The module in this study is a course entitled "Teaching and Classroom Management". Method\: The number of postings by the pre-service teacher on the different processes of ill-structured problem solving and the interactions amongst the participants are analyzed. Result\: The study reveals the weakness of the pre-service teachers in articulating the problem space and their tendency to go straight to generating solutions without going through the other processes of ill-structured problem solving. This paper further points out that these weaknesses are due to insufficient reflective thinking on the part of the pre-service teachers. Conclusion\: Possible strategies to improve the extent of ill-structured problem solving include using films and journal writing to trigger reflective thinking in the pre-service teachers and encourage them to go through the seven steps of the ill-structured problem solving processes. This understanding can inform future use of using asynchronous online discussions to engage learners in ill-structured problem solving. (Contains 3 tables.)

description832=A suspenseful story of two women who find their lives deeply troubled by a path of deception. Corri Montclair ... returns home in 1971 to bury her mother and becomes engulfed in a mystery that will change her life. The surprising emergence of a past lover complicates her struggle to solve the astounding facts and odd bequest presented by her mother's will. Pegeen O'Connor ... defies the conventions of 1895 by falling deeply in love with a Chinese boy. The consequence of this passion propels Pegeen through a life of constant vigilance as she fights to keep a sacred promise, one that protects both her, and more importantly, her child. As Corri grapples to decipher her past, Pegeen's life unfolds and the mysteries and hidden entanglements that irrevocably drive these women together are revealed. Set in California Gold Country, San Francisco, Chinatown, Sacramento, Singapore, Italy, and England, Touch of Magenta is a story about the need for "family," of the sacrifices made for those we love, and the compelling drive to know the truth of our own history

description822=articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com LONDON\: New York erstattet London som verdens ledende finansielle sentrum for første gang, etter at byen ble rystet av en rekke skandalene og spørsmål over Storbritannias plass i EU. New York har topplasseringen i den siste globale finansielle sentre indeksen med en "ustø, statistisk ubetydelig" to-punkts føre, ifølge Michael Mainelli, leder av Z/Yen gruppen, som sammenstiller indeksen. Konkurransen er varme opp, med Hong Kong og Singapore, to ledende asiatisk sentre, innsnevring gapet mellom seg selv og de to øverste til færre enn 30 poeng på en skala på 1000, indeksen viser. Skandalene inkludert banker misbruker sine kunder ved å selge unødvendige forsikring, manipulering av finansielle benchmarks og handel tap, har kombinert skader byens stående, akkurat som planer for en folkeavstemning om EU-medlemskap kastet tvil om vilkårene i tilgangen til dette markedet. Mens New York har utfordret London for pallen siden starten av indeksen, fikk en sevenpoint økning i sin vurdering den topplasseringen etter den britiske hovedstaden LED en 10-punkts nedgang, den største av alle i topp 50. "London trenger et rykte som alle som kommer vil bli behandlet rettferdig og kan konkurrere rettferdig," i henhold til Mainelli. "Uten store innenlandske økonomien bak New York og Hong Kong, London må opptre mer som en Singapore by stat eller har støtte fra et EU innenlandske økonomien." Indeksen, som oppdateres hvert halvår, og i dens 15th edition, er kompilert fra svar på en spørreundersøkelse. Den bruker også eksterne målere inkludert rangeringer for bestemte områder som telekommunikasjon. Indeksen, som ble først publisert i 2007, tar hensyn til fem brede områder som forretningsmiljøet, finans, infrastruktur, menneskelig kapital og omdømme . Den britiske regjeringen "er bestemt å bygge en banksektoren som øker økonomien og støtter forbrukere og bedrifter," sier statskassen. "Det er å skape et rammeverk som fremmer en ansvarlig og bærekraftig finansbransjen, takle problemene av konkurranse og risiko." London borgermester Boris Johnson gjorde en seks dagers besøk til Kina i oktober samtidig at kansler George Osborne ledet handel oppdrag til verdens nest største økonomi. Den britiske regjeringen tar sikte på London å bli det ledende senteret for offshore handel av kinesiske yuan og verdipapirer, og ønsker også å oppmuntre islamsk finans. Myndighetene vil ha sitt arbeid kutte ut for å lage gode på de ambisjonene, ifølge London-baserte Z/Yen. Storbritannias forsoning og forsøk å holde nede antall innvandrere har gjort Storbritannia vises "unwelcoming" utenlandske arbeidere og besøkende, ifølge Z/Yen. London har også lidd fordi Storbritannias plass i EU er ikke bestemt.

description815=The economic openness between nations die certainly to the occurrence of economic development in the same countries as the increasing exports and reducing imports, economic target for each country to increase its economic resources and increase economic growth has and consequently an increase in per capita income, which is reflected on the improvement and welfare of the community and helping to overcome the economic and social problems, One of the main subjects of the Pure Theory of International Trade has been the study of Comparative Advantage, that is, the determination of trade patterns. Ricardo focused on relative cost differences based on technology, whereas the conventional Heckscher-Ohlin model shows that even with identical technologies and constant returns, relative costs can differ if factor proportions differ, Adam Smith was probably the first one to consider the effects of market size on specialization and therefore on volumes exchanged. The theory of commercial policy also establishes a relation between protection and volume of trade, and the researchers suggest  that trade to GDP ratios are market determined variables subject to conventional theoretical analysis and empirical verification, This paper I shall use the ratio D.OP\={(Exports/Imports)x100} as the measure for openness of the economy to countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippine and Thailand  then compare  with each other to gain access to the state the most open and influential in the economy The cause of calculate openness in this way unlike calculating some which combines imports and exports and then divides the result by the gross domestic product to become ratio represents the degree of openness, but cannot measure this degree on economic growth and on economic indicators as is the proportion as in economic sectors that are also a certain percentage and so I would suggest this solution to indicate the degree of economic openness are then estimated using regression models the effect of the degree of economic openness on GDP growth.

description805=In most ways the island nations of Iceland and Singapore could not be more different from each other\: Iceland is sparsely populated, located near the Arctic Circle, and a very free and individualistic democratic society; Singapore is densely populated, located near the equator, and a very regulated and collectivist meritocracy. But both nations promote the optimal education and development of children. These two countries are child-centered and responsive to the physical, psychosocial, and cognitive development of young people. This monograph describes the societal conditions, cultural values, and school contexts in Iceland and Singapore that have led to prosocial values, enthusiasm for learning, and academic achievement among young adolescents. Sources of information were observations, interviews, questionnaires, drawings, cultural experts, academic studies, and international government reports. In international comparisons, adolescents from Iceland scored second of twenty-eight countries and significantly higher than youth from the USA on measures of reading engagement. Adolescents from Singapore scored first of forty-one countries and significantly higher than adolescents from the USA on tests of mathematics. Surveys and drawings were collected from 791 young adolescents in order to understand their values, ideals, and school experiences. The participants were 380 Icelanders (mean age \= 13.9) and 411 Singaporeans (mean age \= 13.2). Icelandic youth expressed desires for positive interpersonal relationships, learning, enjoyment, and individuality and Singaporean youth valued positive interpersonal relationships, hard work, seriousness, and family harmony. The final section of the paper suggests implications for the USA. (Contains 8 figures and 3 tables.) [This research was supported in part by a Messing Award, a Beatrice and David Kornblum Institute for Teaching Excellence grant, and Center for International Education grant.]
description804=A study investigated the effectiveness of improvements in a Singapore graduate training program for elementary school teachers of English as a Second Language. Program changes focused on providing appropriate, constructive feedback to trainees about their teaching practice and developing trainees' skills of critical reflection. The report describes the program, origins and nature of the changes made in it, details of teaching strategies used, and results of the new approach as reflected in observed practice and trainee comments. The course is structured on a basic unit of a one hour lecture session accompanied by two hours of practice or seminar discussion. The latter portion consists of either demonstration lessons by trainers or student demonstration lessons with video review and critique. The demonstration critique includes feedback on instructional procedures used, language objectives, and teacher-pupil interaction. Another element in the course is a project to develop, with a child, a writing assignment. Trainee evaluations of the course indicate that the techniques used were helpful, promoted confidence in the classroom, and further training in the techniques was desired. (MSE)

description788=This article is from BMC Infectious Diseases , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: Few studies have comprehensively described tropical respiratory disease surveillance in military populations. There is also a lack of studies comparing clinical characteristics of the non-influenza pathogens with influenza and amongst themselves. Methods\: From May 2009 through October 2012, 7733 consenting cases of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) (temperature [greater than or equal to]37.5degreesC with cough or sorethroat) and controls in the Singapore military had clinical data and nasal washes collected prospectively. Nasal washes underwent multiplex PCR, and the analysis was limited to viral mono-infections. Results\: 49% of cases tested positive for at least one virus, of whom 10% had multiple infections. 53% of the FRI cases fulfilled the definition of influenza-like illness (ILI), of whom 52% were positive for at least one virus. The most frequent etiologies for mono-infections among FRI cases were Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (13%), Influenza B (13%) and coxsackevirus (9%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of ILI for influenza among FRI cases were 72%, 48%, 40% and 69% respectively. On logistic regression, there were marked differences in the prevalence of different symptoms and signs between viruses with fever more prevalent amongst influenza and adenovirus infections than other viruses. Conclusion\: There are multiple viral etiologies for FRI and ILI with differing clinical symptoms in the Singapore military. Influenza and coxsackevirus were the most common etiology for FRI, while influenza and adenoviruses displayed the most febrile symptoms. Further studies should explore these differences and possible interventions.

description787=This article is from The World Allergy Organization Journal , volume 1 . Abstract The prevalence of childhood allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, has increased exponentially. In Singapore, the prevalence of asthma at all ages exceeds 20%, and around 50% of Singaporean children show features of an underlying allergy. The exact environmental causes for the increase of allergic diseases have not yet been identified, but most researchers agree that a decreased bacterial load in young children may be one of the reasons for the increase. However, the causes of allergy are multiple, and the development of an allergic disease is the result of complex interactions between genetic constitution and environmental factors. In this review article, different aspects of allergic sensitization are covered, including prenatal and postnatal sensitization. The phenomenon of the "allergic march" (switching from one clinical expression of allergy to another) and its underlying mechanisms are discussed. The last part of this review article is on prevention and treatment of allergic diseases, including the role of bacterial products (probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics) and the role of immunotherapy, including sublingual immunotherapy.

description783=As the use of distance education grows, the question arises as to whether there are inherent limitations to the use of such an approach, due to the fact that learning is culturally and experientially mediated. The effective implementation of digital learning environments involves recognizing that successful teaching and learning involves students engaged in a social process of meaning appropriation. This in turn requires that the whole learning environment, not just the technological infrastructure, is designed as a well orchestrated whole. A brief review is presented in this paper of some of the approaches towards distance learning adopted by higher education institutions in both the West and the East (the Open University, United Kingdom, the Virtual College, part of Singapore Polytechnic, the National University of Singapore). Strengths and limitations of online courses are also highlighted. A list of exemplar sources and URL references are appended. (Author/AEF)

description782=This article is from BMC Geriatrics , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: With an aging population and an increasing number of elderly patients with cancer, it is essential for us to understand how cancer physicians approach the management and treatment of elderly cancer patients as well as their methods of cancer diagnosis disclosure to older versus younger patients in Singapore, where routine geriatric oncology service is not available. Methods\: 57 cancer physicians who are currently practicing in Singapore participated in a written questionnaire survey on attitudes towards management of the elderly cancer patient, which included 2 hypothetical clinical scenarios on treatment choices for a fit elderly patient versus that for a younger patient. Results\: The participants comprised of 68% medical oncologists, 18% radiation oncologists, and 14% haematologists. Most physicians (53%) listed performance status (PS) as the top single factor affecting their treatment decision, followed by cancer type (23%) and patient’s decision (11%). The top 5 factors were PS (95%), co-morbidities (75%), cancer stage (75%), cancer type (75%), patient’s decision (53%), and age (51%). 72% of physicians were less likely to treat a fit but older patient aggressively; 53% and 79% opted for less intensive treatments for older patients in two clinical scenarios of lymphoma and early breast cancer, respectively. 37% of physicians acknowledged that elderly cancer patients were generally under-treated.Only 9% of physicians chose to disclose cancer diagnosis directly to the older patient compared to 61% of physicians to a younger patient, citing family preference as the main reason. Most participants (61%) have never engaged a geriatrician’s help in treatment decisions, although the majority (90%) would welcome the introduction of a geriatric oncology programme. Conclusions\: Advanced patient age has a significant impact on the cancer physician’s treatment decision-making process in Singapore. Many physicians still accede to family members’ request and practice non-disclosure of cancer diagnosis to geriatric patients, which may pose as a hurdle to making an informed decision regarding management for the geriatric cancer patients. Having a formal geriatric oncology programme in Singapore could potentially help to optimize the management of geriatric oncology patients.

description778=This article is from BMC Public Health , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: There is extensive evidence that regular physical activity confers numerous health benefits. Despite this, high rates of physical inactivity prevail among older adults. This study aimed to ascertain if incentives could be effective in motivating physical activity through improving uptake of walking programs, either with or without an enrolment fee to cover corresponding costs. Methods\: A discrete-choice conjoint survey was fielded to a national sample of older adults in Singapore. Each respondent was given ten pairs of hypothetical walking programs and asked to choose the option they preferred. Each option varied along several dimensions, including the level and type (cash, voucher, or health savings credit) of incentive and an enrolment fee. For each option, they were asked how likely they would be to join their preferred program. A random utility model (RUM) was used to analyze the responses. Results\: Results suggest that a free 6-month program with a $500 cash incentive would generate enrolment rates of 58.5%; charging $50 to enroll lowers this to 55.7%. In terms of incentive type, cash payments were the most preferred incentive but not significantly different from supermarket vouchers. Both were preferred to health savings credits and sporting goods vouchers. Concerns of adverse selection were minimal because those who were inactive represented at least 72% of new participants for any offered program(s) and were the majority. Conclusions\: Study results demonstrate the potential for even modest incentives to increase program uptake among inactive older adults. Moreover, although cash was the most preferred option, supermarket vouchers, which could potentially be purchased at a discount, were a close alternative. Results also suggest that an enrolment fee is a viable option to offset the costs of incentives as it has only minimal impact on participation.

description777=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: Dengue fever (DF) is one of the most important emerging arboviral human diseases. Globally, DF incidence has increased by 30-fold over the last fifty years, and the geographic range of the virus and its vectors has expanded. The disease is now endemic in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. This study examines the spatiotemporal trends of DF transmission in the Asia-Pacific region over a 50-year period, and identified the disease’s cluster areas. Methodology and Findings\: The World Health Organization’s DengueNet provided the annual number of DF cases in 16 countries in the Asia-Pacific region for the period 1955 to 2004. This fifty-year dataset was divided into five ten-year periods as the basis for the investigation of DF transmission trends. Space-time cluster analyses were conducted using scan statistics to detect the disease clusters. This study shows an increasing trend in the spatiotemporal distribution of DF in the Asia-Pacific region over the study period. Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Singapore and Malaysia are identified as the most likely clusters (relative risk \= 13.02) of DF transmission in this region in the period studied (1995 to 2004). The study also indicates that, for the most part, DF transmission has expanded southwards in the region. Conclusions\: This information will lead to the improvement of DF prevention and control strategies in the Asia-Pacific region by prioritizing control efforts and directing them where they are most needed.

description776=The growing occurrence of natural calamities and disasters has provided many entrepreneurs and government people to innovate in terms of relief and emergency response solutions. Although such events as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions cannot be predicted accurately, the public can be encouraged to prepare for any eventuality and to address immediate risks in order to preserve life and reduce damage to property. Public safety is a primary concern not just of the government authorities but also of every individual and family. This is where technology can serve a vital role in increasing the public’s capability to manage risks due to natural as well as human-induced disasters (economic collapse, massive unemployment, terrorist attacks, etc.). Having a life-support during any emergency situation can help people to cope and to move on with confidence and greater determination to improve our collective effort to support and secure the community. MWI’s Unified Message Switch (UMS) allows users to send messages in various social media formats in one unified infrastructure, providing efficient and faster transmission. Such a facility becomes an advantage when it comes to vital communication links related to disaster management and other rapid-response situations. And even in ordinary communication needs, in business and social media, having this capability allows greater advantage and adaptability to specific messaging requirements in areas as medical service, transportation, construction and police work.

description775=This article is from BMC Health Services Research , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: The 15-item Care Transition Measure (CTM-15) is a measure for assessing the quality of care during transition from the patients’ perspective. The purpose of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the CTM-15 and CTM-3 (a 3-item version of the CTM-15) in Singapore, a multi-ethnic urban state in South-east Asia. Methods\: A consecutive sample of patients was recruited from two tertiary hospitals. The subjects or their proxies were interviewed 3 weeks after discharge from hospital to home in English or Chinese using the CTM-15 questionnaire. Information about patients’ visit to emergency department (ED), non-elective rehospitalisation for the condition of index hospitalisation, and care experience after discharge was also collected from respondents. Psychometric properties of CTM-15 and CTM-3 based on the five-point response scale (i.e. strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree) and the three-point response scale (i.e. [strongly] agree, neutral, and [strongly] disagree) were tested for English and Chinese versions separately. Internal consistency reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha and construct validity was tested with T-test or Pearson’s correlation by examining hypothesised association of CTM scores with ED visit, rehospitalisation, and experience with care after discharge. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to examine latent dimensions of CTM-15. Results\: A total of 414 (proxy\: 96.1%) and 165 (proxy\: 84.8%) subjects completed the interviews in English and Chinese, respectively. Cronbach’s alpha values of the different CTM-15 versions ranged from 0.81 to 0.87. In contrast, Cronbach’s alpha values of the CTM-3 ranged from 0.42 to 0.63. Both CTM-15 and CTM-3 were correlated with care experience after discharge regardless of survey language or response scale (Pearson’s correlation coefficient\: 0.36 to 0.46). Among the English-speaking respondents, the CTM-15 and CTM-3 scores based on both the three- and five-point response scales discriminated well between patients with and without ED visits or rehospitalisation for their index condition. Among Chinese-speaking respondents, no difference in CTM scores was observed between patients with and without ED visits or patients with and without rehospitalisation. The English and Chinese versions of the CTM-15 items demonstrated a similar 4-factor structure representing general care plan, medication, agreement on care plan, and specific care instructions. Conclusions\: The care transition measure is a valid and reliable measure for quality of care transition in Singapore. Moreover, the care transition measure can be administered to proxies using a simpler response scale. The discriminatory power of the Chinese version of this instrument needs to be further tested in future studies.

Abstract Heart failure (HF) carries a major burden of disease in East Asia, with high associated risk of mortality and morbidity. In recent decades, the epidemiology of HF has changed with social and economical development in East Asia. The burden of HF is still severe in East Asia.The prevalence of HF ranges from 1.3% to 6.7% throughout the region. As aetiological factors, ischaemic heart disease has increased and valvular disease reduced in most East Asian countries. Diuretics are the most commonly used drugs (51.0%-97%), followed by renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (59%-77%), with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ACEI, (32%-52%) and has angiotensin-2 receptor blockers, ARBs (31%-44%) in similar proportions. β-blocker use has also increased in recent years.Total mortality from HF ranges from 2% to 9% in China, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. Age>65 years, diabetes mellitus, anaemia, renal dysfunction and atrial fibrillation (AF) are associated with adverse outcome. More prospective, region-specific data are still required, particularly regarding new drug therapies such as eplerenone and ivabradine.

Abstract Background\: Severe epidemics of enterovirus have occurred frequently in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, and China, involving cases of pulmonary edema, hemorrhage and encephalitis, and an effective vaccine has not been available. The specific aim of this study was to understand the epidemiological characteristics of mild and severe enterovirus cases through integrated surveillance data. Methods\: All enterovirus cases in Taiwan over almost ten years from three main databases, including national notifiable diseases surveillance, sentinel physician surveillance and laboratory surveillance programs from July 1, 1999 to December 31, 2008 were analyzed. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient was applied for measuring the consistency of the trends in the cases between different surveillance systems. Cross correlation analysis in a time series model was applied for examining the capability to predict severe enterovirus infections. Poisson temporal, spatial and space-time scan statistics were used for identifying the most likely clusters of severe enterovirus outbreaks. The directional distribution method with two standard deviations of ellipse was applied to measure the size and the movement of the epidemic. Results\: The secular trend showed that the number of severe EV cases peaked in 2008, and the number of mild EV cases was significantly correlated with that of severe ones occurring in the same week [r \= 0.553, p

Objectives\: To examine pediatric asthma mortality and hospitalization trends of selected countries across Asia Pacific, and also patterns of asthma drug utilization. Materials and Methods\: Mortality and population data were sourced from the World Health Organization's mortality database. Data on hospitalization were obtained by direct inquiry and from government and scientific publications. Drug use for asthma was expressed as a controller-to-reliever (C\:R) ratio (ie, units of inhaled corticosteroids/units of short-acting β-agonists, sold in each country). Time-series regression analyses were used to examine temporal patterns and study association between deaths, hospitalizations, and drug use. Results\: Japan showed a decreasing trend in pediatric asthma mortality whereas an increase was observed in Thailand. Hospitalizations decreased in Australia and Singapore but increased in Taiwan, Republic of China. C\:R ratios increased significantly across the countries. Conclusions\: Mixed trends in pediatric asthma mortality and hospitalization rates were observed, which coincided with a uniform increase in C\:R ratios. This may reflect importance of other aspects of asthma management besides pharmacotherapy.

description771=This article is from ZooKeys . Abstract AbstractSpecies of the genus Placospongia are common within the tropical Indo-West Pacific, demonstrating a wide variety of colors and either branching or encrusting growth forms. A revision of Indo-West Pacific Placospongia was undertaken based on a redescription of the holotypes of species of Placospongia from the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific and an examination of an additional 103 specimens of Placospongia ssp. collected from Indonesia (including Vosmaer and Vernhout 1902 material), Seychelles, India, Singapore and Micronesia. One mitochondrial (COI) and one nuclear (ITS) marker were subsequently used to differentiate species. All Placospongia species are characterized by selenasters and tylostyles in two size classes. The combination of microsclere diversity and morphology as well as megasclere size were shown to be informative morphometric characters, supported by molecular evidence. Live coloration and growth form is shown to be unreliable for diagnoses. The study of holotypes found that Placospongia mixta is a valid species and that two genus transfers are necessary\: Geodinella anthosigma is a Placospongia and Placospongia labyrinthica is a Geodia. A new species is also described from an anchialine pool in Indonesia, Placospongia santodomingoaesp. n.; bringing the total fauna of Placospongia species in the Indo-West Pacific to five\: Placospongia anthosigma, Placospongia carinata, Placospongia mixta, Placospongia melobesioides, and Placospongia santodomingoaesp. n. An identification key is given. Two additional species, possibly morphologically cryptic, have been identified by molecular markers.

description770=A lot of small businesses nowadays are struggling to keep up with the fast pace of industrialization and modernization. In order to compete, you have to be more creative and think of out-of-box thinking. Small businesses have traditionally been the key driver for economic recovery when it comes to hiring, but hiring requires capital, and capital can be hard to come by. In order for you to find solutions for your unending financial needs, Axis Capital Group Business Funding, which has serviced the United States and now expands to Jakarta, Indonesia, has prepared ways for you to get started with your small business\: • Do it yourself. Most entrepreneurs and small business owners these days have come to the realization that they will have to self-fund (also known as “boot-strapping”) their projects for a significant amount of time until more formal funding opportunities become realistic. Before starting a business, of course, business owners should already have this outlook that you have to spend for your own somehow. If you believe in your vision and have an absolute refusal to accept failure as an option, you should feel comfortable investing you own money into the business. In turn, this will make potential investors more comfortable knowing you have skin in the game.  • Friends, family, and fools. Review who are closest to you. Those closest to you are more likely than anyone to believe not only in your vision, but your ability to make that vision a reality. One downside of course is that you are potentially risking personal relationships should the business fail and your agreement not be structured properly. Juts borrow enough money which you can’t afford to set up your website and such so as not to burn any bridges around you. You might be faced with tons of complaints even before you are starting.  • Small business loans. Yes, this do exists and we happen to be in this business. We are in fact extending even in Asia including Jakarta, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong. Since banks are stricter and harder to deal with, lenders like us came into being. Another reason to pursue debt financing is that you aren’t giving away a piece of your business. Regardless of which path you take, chances are that you may do all of these at some point as your business grows.  At the end of the day, you have a business to run and none of these matters unless it has your full attention. So find a viable funding solution that also allows you to maintain operations and focus on profitability.

description767=Resilience is a universal capacity that allows a child to prevent, minimize, or overcome the damaging effects of adversity. The construct of resiliency, the combination of protective factors that result in resilience, was addressed by the International Resilience Project (IRP), which set out to explore what parents, caregivers, teachers or children can do that seems to promote resilience in children. Protective factors noted include the dispositional attributes of the individual, family attributes, and school and community environment. The IRP determined that children overcome adversity by drawing on three sources of resilience, labeled "I have,""I am,""I can." To test these resilience features, 39 children in a Singapore primary school were given an adapted version of the Child's Perception of Resilience Checklist, as used in the IRP. The study determined that it is possible to draw a common set of resilience factors in a particular cultural setting to promote resilience in children, and that a number of strong resilience factors were shown; however, while the children do use resilience-promoting behaviors, these depend largely on the individual situation. The results reinforce the role of family and school as protective factors for the developing child. (JPB)

description765=This study investigated the ability of preschool children in Singapore to conserve number, length, and quantity. Participants were more than 200 children of 3 to 6 years who attended one of six different types of preschool centers. Findings indicated that more than half of the 5.5-year-old children were able to conserve number, but less than 15 percent attained conserver status on length and quantity (liquid substance) tasks. Children in private kindergartens appeared to conserve earlier than did age-mates at nonprivate centers, but were eclipsed by the preprimary pupils in the senior age cohort. Though nonprivate pupils in the younger cohort appeared to lead in conserving length, private center students soon surpassed them. The preprimary children did not do well on the length task. Subjects from nonprivate kindergartens did better than private kindergarteners in conserving quantity. On the whole, results on length and quantity tasks were erratic. Use of the child's preferred language during testing supported previous findings concerning the effectiveness of such language use. It is concluded that provision of relevant activities is important in the development of the ability to conserve. Such activities need not be sophisticated or expensive. Practice in verbalization and causal reasoning give added advantage in tasks involving explanation. Numerous charts and graphs are provided, and nearly 50 references are cited. (RH)

Based on the various indicators of technological activity and competitiveness presented in this report, several Asian economies stand out. They are apparently headed toward greater prominenced as developers of technology and will become visible competitors in product markets. Japan stands alone as the most advanced industrialized country in the region. Four others--Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan--often referred to as the "four tigers" or as the newly industrialized economies, have made dramatic leaps forward in the global economy over the past decade. The remaining four countries--China, India, Malaysia, and Indonesia--lag far behind these other countries in economic and technological development.

description763=Whether to adopt national standards and tests has long been a subject of lively debate in the United States. With 47 states now participating in the Common Core State Standards Initiative, and a commitment from Education Secretary Arne Duncan to allocate hundreds of millions in stimulus funds to the development of common tests, the country is better positioned than ever before to take the leap. Still, many questions and pitfalls remain. This report looks beyond America's borders for guidance on how we might best make a transition to an acceptable, workable form of national standards and tests. An examination of the systems and histories of ten countries--Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea--led to six key insights, described herein. Lessons from Germany are particularly salient, as that federal nation recently embarked on a strategy similar to the Common Core State Standards Initiative. As this report illustrates, many high-performing countries with national education standards have education systems that are even more decentralized in their operation than ours, at least in terms of the autonomy enjoyed by school-level educators. This and other lessons are outlined in these pages in an effort to shed light upon how the United States might also tread a path toward national standards, even national testing, without sacrificing our fealty to local control, properly conceived. The six key insights are\: (1) It's not true that national standards portend loss of local control; (2) An independent, quasi-governmental institution is needed to oversee the development of national standards and assessment and produce reports for the nation; (3) The federal government should encourage and provide resources for the standards-setting process but shouldn't meddle inappropriately; (4) We ought first to develop coherent, focused, rigorous standards for English, math, and science; (5) National assessments (including open-ended questions) should be administered every other calendar year in grades 4, 8, and 12; (6) Hold students, teachers and schools accountable for performance. Appended are country profiles and supplementary tables. (Contains 9 tables and 7 footnotes.) [Foreword by Chester E. Finn, Jr., Michael J. Petrilli, and Amber M. Winkler.]

description762=Properly implementing telematics is necessary nowadays because it could increase driver safety and productivity. Many companies also regard this technology as a competitive advantage. Enforcing policies, modifying driver behavior, and reducing fuel costs are some of the major advantages of telematics technology, based on reviews made by MWI Consultants. It is evident that our modern world is becoming more connected every day, and one of the reasons why is the constant change in methods used in location-based information brought by different applications for telematics. In order to coordinate a large number of vehicles fleets handle, they choose to use fleet management software - a branch of telematics. Telematics and its strong impact on fleet effectiveness show its great importance to the management of fleet vehicles. Metropolitan Wireless International Consulting found that some of the hidden advantages of telematics include right-sizing your fleet, optimal replacement planning, reducing downtime, and fraud prevention. One of the capabilities of telematics is enabling fleet managers to identify underutilized units more accurately and evaluate utilization patterns of every asset. Telematics provide full particulars of odometer reporting, fleet maintenance issues, driving habits and vehicle utilization patterns to enhance the vehicle life cycle planning of fleet managers as well as lower the fleet's overall costs. It can also help you prevent any serious problems that may cause large costs and downtime because telematics can alert you beforehand about impending vehicle maintenance events. Telematics can guide fleet managers to take proactive action on determining extended downtime events, calculating the overall cost of employee productivity and other related costs. With this technology, it is also possible to prevent fraud wherein it can help you identify when jobs are reported as completed but drivers were never at the particular location, or when fuel purchases don't match up with the location or vehicle. Metropolitan Wireless International has been providing advanced solutions for the mobile wireless communication and control systems since 2009, and one of which is the TelematicsHUB. It is a complete solution for improving the efficiency of vehicle transportation on roads.

description757=Vertical profiles of 0.532 µm aerosol particle extinction coefficient and linear volume depolarization ratio are described for Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent. Quality-screened and cloud-cleared Version 3.01 Level 2 NASA Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) 5-km Aerosol Profile datasets are analyzed from 2007 to 2009. Numerical simulations from the U.S. Naval Aerosol Analysis and Predictive System (NAAPS), featuring two-dimensional variational assimilation of NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi-angle Imaging Spectro- Radiometer quality-assured datasets, combined with regional ground-based lidar measurements, are considered for assessing CALIOP retrieval performance, identifying bias, and evaluating regional representativeness. CALIOP retrievals of aerosol particle extinction coefficient and aerosol optical depth (AOD) are high over land and low over open waters relative to NAAPS (0.412/0.312 over land for all data points inclusive, 0.310/0.235 when the per bin average is used and each is treated as single data points; 0.102/0.151 and 0.086/0.124, respectively, over ocean). Regional means, however, are very similar (0.180/0.193 for all data points and 0.155/0.159 when averaged per normalized bin), as the two factors offset one another. The land/ocean offset is investigated, and discrepancies attributed to interpretation of particle composition and a-priori assignment of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio ("lidar ratio") necessary for retrieving the extinction coefficient from CALIOP signals. Over land, NAAPS indicates more dust present than CALIOP algorithms are identifying, indicating a likely assignment of a higher lidar ratio representative of more absorptive particles. NAAPS resolvesmore smoke overwater than identified with CALIOP, indicating likely usage of a lidar ratio characteristic of less absorptive particles to be applied that biases low AOD there. Over open waters except within the Bay of Bengal, aerosol particle scattering is largely capped below 1.5 km MSL, though ground-based lidar measurements at Singapore differ slightly from this finding. Significant aerosol particle presence over land is similarly capped near 3.0 km MSL over most regions. Particle presence at low levels regionally, except over India, is dominated by relatively non-depolarizing particles. Industrial haze, sea salt droplets and fresh smoke are thus most likely present.

The teaching of thinking skills has always been one feature of NIE preservice programs, though a number of changes have recently been proposed, including integration of thinking skills into the content and delivery of courses and use of recent research and best practices to promote critical and creative thinking. A process-oriented approach to instruction will be emphasized. There will be more emphasis on thinking during the practicum. NIE will initiate research in the area of critical thinking and creativity. The establishment of the Singapore Centre for Teaching Thinking is one initiative that demonstrates NIE's commitment to realizing Singapore's vision of "Thinking Schools, Learning Nation." It's three core activities are teaching/training, development of programs and materials, and research and research dissemination. Inservice training for current teachers will involve a series of workshops during the June and December vacation months. The school curriculum will also be reviewed and revised to encourage development of higher order thinking skills, incorporate technology, emphasize joy of learning and development of habits for continual learning, and reduce content in each area.

The results suggested that student teachers in Singapore showed positive intentions to integrate technology to facilitate student-centered learning in their future teaching. However, they reported that they were more likely to use technology as a supporting and instructional tool during their student teaching rather than using technology to promote student-centered learning. Qualitative findings from 10 purposefully selected participants showed consistency with the quantitative results.

description753=Writing picture compositions is part of the requirements for the mother tongue language learning in Singapore primary schools. For Chinese as a mother tongue, the prevailing materials used for learning picture composition are confined to only black-and-white drawn pictures. This has caused some problems\: (1) not many good and suitable black-and-white drawn pictures are available for the teachers to prepare for their lessons; (2) even there is, the processes of preparing for a composition lesson with these pictures is quite time-consuming and (3) black-and-white drawn pictures are not necessarily realistic and interesting enough to motivate pupils. The aim of this study was to experiment the use of color digital photographs in Chinese picture composition lessons. It hoped to achieve two objectives\: (1) to investigate the pupils' preferences for the use of color photographs in composition lessons; and (2) to find out if the use of color photographs can help improve pupils' performance. This study followed the action research approach and progressed through three cycles of school testing. At the end of the third cycle of school testing, a survey was administered to 194 pupils; an interview was carried out with 23 pupils; and a debriefing was also conducted with the six subject teachers. In addition, the pupils' marks ere collected and analyzed for their performance. The study found that majority of the students preferred the use color photographs in composition lessons, and their marks appeared to support this observation. Only a few pupils were either neutral or not in total agreement. The teachers, on the other hand, believed that using color photographs has the potential of helping them better prepare their composition lessons. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)

description752=Background\: Asynchronous online discussion (AOD) has found widespread use in tertiary education and adult learning environment; however, there has been little research on its use in elementary school, especially in the context of the teaching of the Chinese Language. This study explores the use of AOD in a Chinese Language class in a primary school in Singapore. Aims\: To investigate\: (1) The perceptions of elementary students toward the use of AOD in the learning of the Chinese Language; (2) The factors perceived by students that would encourage them to participate more in the AOD; (3) If students perceived that using AOD could help them improve their Chinese writing and reading abilities; and (4) If students perceived that they thought more in AOD as compared to face-to-face interactions with their classmates, or classroom teaching by the teacher in the learning of the Chinese Language. Sample\: A class of 29 primary four students (n\=29, 8 boys and 21 girls) with ages between 9-10 years old in Singapore. Method\: A qualitative case study methodology was employed. This approach was suitable given that the key purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of students' perceptions towards using AOD in an elementary school Chinese language lesson, rather than to make generalizations or prove/disprove underlying hypotheses. Data collection methods included the use of questionnaire and interviews. Results\: Students were generally positive about the use of AOD in the learning of the Chinese Language and felt that their reading and writing abilities had improved. Students perceived that the following factors "if in existence" would encourage them to participate more in the online discussion activities\: the posting of the messages (e.g., submitting the messages to the discussion board) is faster, the ability to access internet whenever they want, stronger Chinese language ability, and faster typing skills in Chinese. A majority of the students felt that they thought more in AOD as compared to face-to-face interactions with their peers or classroom teaching by their teacher. Conclusion\: The findings revealed that AOD was useful in engaging the students in the learning of the Chinese Language in an elementary school. However, more research has to be done to validate this. Further research can also be done on students with lower ability in the Chinese language. (Contains 4 tables.)

description737=This article is from Genome Medicine , volume 6 . Abstract Common infrastructures and platforms are required for international collaborations in large-scale human genomic research and policy development, such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health and the ‘ELSI 2.0’ initiative. Such initiatives may require international harmonization of ethical and regulatory requirements. To enable this, however, a greater understanding of issues and practices that relate to the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genomic research will be needed for the different countries and global regions involved in such research. Here, we review the ELSI practices and regulations for genomic research in six East Asian countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), highlighting the main similarities and differences between these countries, and more generally, in relation to Western countries. While there are significant differences in ELSI practices among these East Asian countries, there is a consistent emphasis on advancing genomic science and technology. In addition, considerable emphasis is placed on informed consent for participation in research, whether through the contribution of tissue samples or personal information. However, a higher level of engagement with interested stakeholders and the public will be needed in some countries.

description728=This article is from Journal of Epidemiology , volume 22 . Abstract In this era of chronic diseases, large studies are essential in investigating genes, environment, and gene–environment interactions as disease causes, particularly when associations are important but not strong. Moreover, to allow expansion and generalization of the results, studies should be conducted in populations outside Western countries. Here, we briefly describe the Asia Cohort Consortium (ACC), a collaborative cancer cohort research project that was first proposed in 2004 and now involves more than 1 million healthy individuals across Asia. There are approximately 50 active members from Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, and elsewhere. To date, the work of the ACC includes 3 articles published in 2011 on the roles of body mass index, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption in mortality, diabetes, and cancer of the small intestine. Many challenges remain, including data harmonization, resolution of ethical and legal issues, establishment of protocols for biologic samples and transfer agreements, and funding procurement.

description724=Across the educational systems of the world, few issues receive more attention than the problem of ensuring that elementary- and secondary-school classrooms are staffed with adequately qualified teachers. Even in nations where students routinely score high on international exams, the issue of teacher quality is the subject of concern. It is widely believed that the quality of teachers and teaching are among the most important factors shaping the learning and growth of students, an impact that goes beyond student academic achievement. Across the world, observers routinely tie the performance of teachers to numerous, larger societal goals and problems, including economic competitiveness and productivity, juvenile delinquency, and moral and civic culture. Along with a general consensus among many nations that the quality of teachers and teaching is a vital resource, there is accordingly concern surrounding how equitably this resource is distributed within educational systems. Some nations suffer from an apparent paradox\: despite an overall overproduction and oversupply of new teachers, there appear to be substantial numbers of students without access to qualified teachers. This report presents the results from a collaborative, comparative study of the qualifications of elementary and secondary teachers undertaken by a group of scholars, policy makers and senior education officials from six nations and one region\: United States, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. This study revealed both commonalities and differences in the preparation and qualifications of teachers among the seven systems examined. Comparative educational research can provide a useful function by placing educational systems in context. Results from each nation or region are individually presented. The study suggests at least three possible sources of the problem of under-qualified teachers\: (1) Pre-employment requirements and standards; (2) Failure of the teaching force to meet existing requirements and standards; and (3) How teachers are utilized once on the job due to mis-assignment or out-of-field teaching. Focusing on upgrading the training requirements of teachers and teacher recruitment may overlook the impact of the organizational and occupational contexts within which teachers work. The data indicate that solutions to the problem of under-qualified teachers also must look to how schools are managed and how teachers are utilized once they are on the job. Recruiting thousands of new candidates and providing them with rigorous preparation will not solve the problem if large numbers of teachers receive assignments for which they are not prepared.

description722=The Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scales (MIDAS) instrument was developed to measure eight constructs of intelligence. The 119-item MIDAS provides scores for 26 subscales in addition to the 8 major scales. Using the 26 subscales, a factor structure was developed on half of a U.S. sample of college students (n\=834), while the second half was compared to six samples of college students and young adults from Canada (n\=203), Chile (n\=202), Korea (South Korea; n\=200)), Singapore (n\=284), Taiwan (n\=203), and the United Kingdom (n\=190). Multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis was used to investigate the fit of the imposed model as parameters were progressively relaxed. The seven groups were found to differ little even when the factor structure constraints were fully relaxed. A pairwise comparison between the U.S. sample and each of the remaining six groups found that the factor structure was common in the most relevant aspects for the Canadian and United Kingdom samples, but some differences were found for the remaining groups. The group showing the least in common with the U.S. factor structure was Korea. The overall results are supportive of multiple intelligences being viewed as abilities that are influenced by cultural content. (Contains 1 figure, 8 tables, and 20 references.) (Author/SLD)

In adaptive processing, weights are attached to the Incoming signal at each element to produce nulls in the directions of interferers. However, mutual coupling is normally ignored in such processing. Instead, the principle of pattern multiplication is used, where the assumption is that the radiation pattern of an array is the individual radiation pattern of the elements multiplied by an array factor. This assumption ignores mutual couplings and the error can be significant under certain conditions. This work begins by setting up the scenario of an adaptive array in a mobile communications scenario in a scattering environment. Following that, we introduce the theories of mutual couplings and beam-forming\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0\nRepublic of Singapore Navy author\ndk/dk cc\:9116 7/6/99\n
description720=2017 skat sæson begyndte denne måned og lokale skat revisor, Jennifer Eubanks med Mcneel CPA tilbyder nogle tips til folk, der endnu ikke har indgivet deres tilbagebetaling. "En masse mennesker, der er selvstændige ikke ser at tage den selvstændige sygesikring," siger Eubanks, "Med sygesikring er så høje, kan du tage et fradrag." En anden fradrag Eubanks siger folk ofte glip er deres sundhed opsparingskonto hvor du sætte penge ind på kontoen, men kun bruge det til at betale medicinske regninger. "Du får også til at tage et fradrag på selvangivelsen for at sætte penge ind på en sundhed opsparing konto," siger Eubanks. "Det er lidt ligesom en pensionering konto bortset fra det er for lægeudgifter." Betydning ligesom en 401k, jo mere du lægger i mindre skattepligtige indkomst du har, øge din tilbagebetaling. Et andet tip er for forældre, der har børn i college, amerikansk mulighed for skattefradrag. "Noget, der vedrører skole som bøger, undervisning," siger Eubanks. "Enhver form for kvalificerende udgifter for at de kan tage fradraget så de skal holde med alle de udgifter, de har mens de er i skole." Eubanks siger IRS sprængning på svig året forsinker frigivelsen af arbejdsindkomst kreditter og ekstra barn skat indtil midten af februar. "Hævder børn der ikke formodes for at være på deres selvangivelse så IRS undersøger i flere af disse arbejdsindkomst kredit forsøger at fjerne en masse af svig," siger Eubanks. Når arkivering din afgifter Eubanks siger at holde alle dine indtægter og udgifter organiseret for at lette indgivelse proces. Arbejdsgivere har indtil 31 Jan. sende W-2 former og selvangivelser skal indgives af 18 April.

description717=This report consists of two papers on caregiving in Asian countries. The first, "Caregiving in Developing East and Southeast Asian Countries" by Nelson W. S. Chow, discusses the change in the caregiving pattern for the urban elderly in developing countries of East and Southeast Asia. It includes examples from studies carried out in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, and Shanghai. It is noted that, although the majority of the urban elderly are living with their families, the difficulties they encounter are still great, and the dependent economic position in which most of the elderly find themselves has reduced the respect shown to them and has made them feel inadequate and isolated. The second presentation, "Caregiving among Middle and Low Income Aged in Hong Kong" by Alex Y. H. Kwan, highlights some of the problems faced by the elderly when a society moves from being a traditional agrarian, trading-port community into an urbanized, international finance society of nearly 6 million people. Strains being experienced by the elderly and their families are identified, with an emphasis on caregivers and how Western values tend to affect support systems and family networks. The usefulness of community care programs in Hong Kong is examined. The article concludes that, although the family system is still playing the major role in providing the elderly with necessary care, the kind of care provided is far from satisfactory. (NB)

description715=In response to recent stress on incorporating core thinking into subject curriculum, the mediated learning experience (MLE) is being incorporated into the preservice training modules of the Singapore National Institute of Education (NIE). This study examines\: (1) factors contributing to the preservice teacher's commitment to using MLE; (2) specific components of MLE that are actually implemented; (3) the extent to which teachers manifest any transfer when teaching content areas; and (4) practical problems faced by teachers when implementing MLE in a school setting. This study is ongoing and only qualitative data have been analyzed so far. Preservice graduate teachers (n\=46) were given 20 hours of training in the application of MLE criteria during their first year at NIE. Graduate teacher trainees were posted for about 10 weeks of teaching practice (practicum) in several primary and secondary schools. Anecdotal records, videotapes of MLE lessons and a reflective rating scale were used. Most participants reported that they would continue to use MLE procedures even after graduation; some suggested that in-service training would facilitate proper implementation of the program.

description711=This bulletin addresses the topic of out-of-school science education (OSSE) as it is occurring and developing in the countries of the Asia and Pacific region of Unesco. Out-of-school programs/activities are both complementary of and supplementary to science education in the schools, providing activities that the constraints of schooling usually exclude from the curriculum. The first section comprises an introduction to the concept, suggested approaches, and a review of strategies employed by 13 out of the 15 countries represented. The second section consists of individual reports from Australia, Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and Thailand. Areas addressed in these reports include science museums, science clubs, science fairs, and media use (television, radio, printed media). In addition, programs/activities unique to a given country are also discussed. These include the Science Foundation Programme (Philippines), Nature Conservation Association (Republic of Korea), Bangkok Planetarium (Thailand), and others. The final section consists of an annotated bibliography of out-of-school science education activities/programs. (JN)

description709=A rigorous K-12 science education builds student knowledge in core scientific content and equips students to analyze problems, use evidence, and investigate solutions. The education requirements of careers across the economy are increasing and all students--regardless of whether they pursue science as a career--need greater proficiency in the knowledge and practice of science to be fully ready for college and the workforce. A coalition of states joined forces from 2011 to 2013 to develop a new set of science standards, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), which outline what it means to be fully college and career ready in science. These standards are internationally benchmarked and draw from the practices of the highest-performing countries on international assessments, such as Singapore, Finland, Korea, Canada, and Japan. The NGSS are structured so that students are asked to engage in hands-on practices as they learn subject-based content; through an emphasis on cross-cutting concepts, the standards also build students' knowledge of ideas that apply across science disciplines. The standards follow a clear developmental progression so that knowledge builds logically from kindergarten through twelfth grade. The Framework for K-12 Science Education, developed by the National Research Council and published in July 2011, forms the basis for the structure and scientific content of the NGSS. The Framework presents three key dimensions that are incorporated in each of the science standards\: (1) Practices; (2) Cross-Cutting Concepts; and (3) Disciplinary Core Ideas. Twenty-six states voluntarily joined the process to develop science standards based on the Framework. As of March 2014, 11 states and the District of Columbia have officially adopted the NGSS, and each state is now developing its own implementation strategy. The case studies in this document provide a closer look at the strategies four states utilized through the NGSS writing and review process. The first two states, Rhode Island and California, have officially adopted the standards and are currently in the process of developing implementation plans. Minnesota and North Carolina were involved as lead states in the NGSS development process and provide useful examples of how state leaders are paving the way for a more rigorous K-12 science education.

description707=Using the international database of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), this study estimated the effect of class size on student performance in 18 countries, combining school fixed effects and instrumental variables to identify random class-size variation between 2 adjacent grades within individual schools. Conventional estimates of class-size effects are shown to be severely biased by the nonrandom placement of students between and within schools. Smaller classes exhibit beneficial effects only in countries with relatively low teacher salaries. While sizeable beneficial effects of smaller classes were found in Greece and Iceland, the possibility of even small effects is rejected for Japan and Singapore. In 121 countries, the findings rule out large class-size effects. An appendix discusses the sample of countries. (Contains 4 figures, 19 tables, and 23 references.) (SLD)

description706=Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been around for the last decade for the protection of products being distributed to prevent being scammed or passed on to fraudulent hands. Nowadays, many companies have been campaigning to incorporate RFID in many products. One of the most prevalent and perhaps, one which need it the most is are medicines which continue to be counterfeited across the globe. Many medicine houses are already tagging their products with validation and seal bearing RFID for their names. The Peterson Group has been one of the non-profit organizations to help implement proper tagging, branding and scanning for many medicines. Unfortunately however, there are still developing cities and countries which lack the necessary methods, tools and equipment to adapt the procurement of RFID on local production of medicines. As a result, Jakarta, Indonesia , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, India and Brunei in Asia and almost all of Africa have been relying on products from other developed countries which cannot be ensured of proper RFID notification.   The proliferation of counterfeit medicines in many hospitals and clinics across these developing cities and nations has been vital. It takes time for RFID methods to be fully adapted across the globe. Pfizer and other leading medicine manufacturers have already started their own investigations and campaigns. Pfizer is tagging all their Viagra packages intended for sale in the U.S. with RFID. GlaxoSmithKline, Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson are also participating in pilots and the creation of standards, as well as tagging products deemed susceptible to counterfeiting.   According to estimation reviews by the National crime prevention council as much as 10% of all pharmaceuticals in the global supply chain might be counterfeit and in some developing countries the percentage might go up as high as 70%. Many developing nations rely on barcodes for security. However, these barcodes put in packs are not guarantee of legitimate products. These barcodes are not unique enough for each product and can be easily copied. RFID tags, on the other hand are unique and hard to tamper with.   RFID may be expensive now but can greatly reduce the billions of dollars lost for counterfeit medicines yearly. As an investment for the near future, RFID can be a very useful tool in product planning and security not only for the manufacturers and the legitimacy of the products for the health and wellness concerns of patients and consumers as well. 
description705=This article is from BMC Infectious Diseases , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: Patients newly colonised with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are at higher risk of clinical MRSA infection. At present, there are limited data on the duration or magnitude of this risk in a hospital population with a known time of MRSA acquisition. Methods\: A retrospective cohort study of 909 adult patients known to have newly identified MRSA colonisation during admission to National University Hospital, Singapore between 1 July 2007 and 30 June 2011 was undertaken. Patients were excluded if they had history of previous MRSA colonisation or infection, or if they had been a hospital inpatient in the preceding 12 months. Data were collected on the development of MRSA infection requiring hospitalisation up to 30 June 2012. Results\: Of 840 patients newly colonised with MRSA as identified on active surveillance and not clinical specimens, 546 were men (65.0%) and the median age was 65 years (range 18–103 years). Median follow up was 24 months (range 0 –64 months, 85.1% followed >6 months). Clinical infection occurred in 121 patients (14.4%) with median time to infection of 22 days (95% CI 14–31). Overall 71.9% (87/121) of infected patients developed infection within 60 days of the date MRSA colonisation was detected. However, 17/121 patients (14.0%) developed clinical infection more than six months after documented MRSA acquisition. The most common sites of clinical infection were skin and soft tissue (49/121, 40.5%, 95% CI 31.7-49.8), respiratory tract (37/121, 30.6%, 95% CI 22.5-39.6) and bone and joint infections (14/121, 11.6%, 95% CI 6.5-18.7). Thirteen patients (13/121, 10.7%, 95% CI 5.8-17.7) had bacteraemias, of which six (5.0% 95% CI 1.8-10.5) were primary and seven (5.7%, 95% CI 2.3-11.6) were secondary to infection at other sites. Crude mortality at 30 days and six months was higher in patients with MRSA infection than colonisation alone (aOR 5.49, 95% CI 2.75-10.95, p

description702=This study examines four Singapore teachers' reflections on issues and problems in their teaching practices. As an insider-outsider or educator-researcher seeking to understand the complexities of teaching, we interrogated the teachers' beliefs, dilemmas, biasness and prejudices embedded in their reflective narratives on experiences in curriculum work within an education system which is dominantly centralized and highly routinized. The teachers reexamined taken-for-granted practice and beliefs, and revised their written reflections. The recursive process of reflection and meta-reflection reveals more critical insights into the curriculum work and teaching. This shows that superficial forms of reflections are easily constructed, but critical reflections, especially on race and gender issues in teaching, tend to be ignored. Analysis of the reflective narratives written by the teachers showed divergence in their experiences as science teachers despite of teaching in a seemingly centralized and homogenous system. The findings suggested that interrogation of teachers' reflections could provoke more critical and in-depth reflections on normative teaching practice and offer teachers a platform for their voices to be heard.

description701=This paper reports on a study of the content of library and information science (LIS) journals published in Australasia (e.g., Australian Library Journal, Fiji Library Journal, New Zealand Libraries, and Singapore Libraries). The study's purpose was to analyze how the content of Australasian LIS journals is affecting knowledge creation among the LIS community of professionals, technicians, academics, and students in Australasia. The paper begins by providing contextual information for the study, i.e., definitions of key terms and concepts. The contextual information is followed by a literature review that includes an analysis of the LIS publishing industry in Australasia. The next section is a description of the methodology of the research, then the content analysis of the journals, and finally the conclusions drawn from this analysis.

description698=Studies that investigated students' attitudes toward mathematics and its relationships with achievement are scarce in Singapore. To address this issue, the mathematics attitudes and achievement of 984 junior college students were measured. Results indicated that students had positive attitudes toward mathematics but lacked intrinsic motivation to do mathematics. Students were extrinsically motivated to study mathematics, but the relationship between extrinsic motivation and achievement was weak. However, there was a significant positive correlation between intrinsic motivation and achievement. This is contrary to the beliefs of many educators and parents in Singapore who believe in extrinsic rewards and punishments to encourage better achievement. This study suggests that Singapore educators and parents should focus more on how to motivate students intrinsically. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

description697=The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the total system of technological education in Singapore. The educational system, its history, and its response to technological needs are first briefly described. A discussion follows of the evolution of the various infrastructures, including the National University of Singapore, Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Technical College, the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB), Economic Development Board training centers, and VITB-approved training centers. Some major changes that the various infrastructures within the total education and training system have made to respond to economic restructuring in the 1980s are then described. These include the New Education System in the schools, school program revision, a VITB project to develop a Resource and Staff Training Centre, expansion of computer studies, and the recommended establishment of the Nanyang Technological Institute to train engineers.

description669=This research explored the impact of relevant knowledge on the purchase intention of Plant-factory-produced plants. We conducted surveys and distributed 156 questionnaires (77 males, 79 females) in Singapore, and 42 questionnaires (18 males, 24 females) in Japan. The main questions were regarding whether participants had knowledge of hydroponic plants and whether that knowledge influenced their preference between Plant-factory-produced and farmland-produced plants under three different price levels. Our results showed that, in Singapore, the possession of the relevant knowledge about the Plant Factory could facilitate the purchase of Plant-factory-produced plants. Under all these three price levels, the purchase intention of Plantfactory-produced plants of people with knowledge of hydroponic plants was always higher than that of people without knowledge of hydroponic plants. In Japan, however, knowledge did not significantly influence the participants’ purchase intention of Plant-factory-produced plants. Moreover, the price is also an important factor, which can determine the purchase intention of Plant-factory-produced plants both in Singapore and Japan.

description668=Presented in the principal article, "Planning, Starting, and Operating an Educational Incentives Project," is a summary of activities to date in an educational savings project in Taiwan. The incentive project is designed to reward those couples who limit their family size, by providing funds for their children's secondary and higher education. To pretest the nationwide program, a pilot program was implemented in September, 1971, one of the first such plans to have been adapted to local conditions. Design of the pilot project, its procedures (preliminary survey, promotion, enrollment, eligibility, and financing), evaluation, and the nationwide scheme are described. Although it will be several years before the effect of this program on fertility is known, it is felt a review of the initial stages may be of value to those who wish to implement similar projects. Also included in the paper are two further reports\: "Singapore\: A Cost-Effect Analysis of a Family Planning Program" and "IUDs and the Birth Rate in Greenland." The first reports statistically an analysis of cost by method and demonstrates one way cost data can be used in measuring cost-effectiveness. The second describes the results of an IUD program in Narssaq District, South Greenland. (BL)

description667=The primary concern of this essay is to review the strategic significance of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore as they relate to the overall problem of freedom of the seas. Literature from the United States Army War College Library, the University of Washington Library, as well as material from the Seattle, Washington and King County Public Libraries were consulted. The geography and history of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore have combined to produce an extremely sensitive situation, which is of vital interest to the major industrial nations of the world, as well as all nations in the eastern littoral of the Indian Ocean, or the southwestern littoral of the Western Pacific. These two significant bodies of water affect not only the balance of power and the economic well-being of Asia, but the longrange settlement of the legal and actual status of all of the 115 straits throughout the world. In doing research for this essay, the author has considered logical alternatives and made recommendations which should form the basis of United States policy for dealing with this complex problem.

description665=This paper addresses the ecology of communicative language teaching (CLT) by reflecting on the Singapore experience. It reviews how CLT was conceptualized, advocated and implemented in stages/phases as reflected in the different syllabuses by the Ministry of Education, Singapore. In anchoring the discussion against a historical backdrop and examining the ecology and evolution of English language teaching in Singapore, it focuses on two English Language syllabuses published in 1991 and 2001 respectively. It illustrates the operational issues in reference to the two syllabuses, with a focus on the ecology of such pedagogical innovations and how the ecological nature of CLT is mirrored in the syllabuses. Highlighting issues such as mismatches between what the syllabus documents stipulate and what practitioners bring into English language classrooms and how success in implementation can be achieved when training is provided timely, it also discusses theory-practice connection and the integration issue that is most often debated in the teacher-education literature. It concludes with a discussion of possible implications of the Singapore CLT experience for ELT in China. (Contains 1 table, 2 figures, and 1 footnote.)

Carol Fong, VD för CIMB värdepapper, sade\: “efterfrågan, som väntat, var inte stor, men vi förväntar oss att plocka upp förtroende växer.” OCBC Securities sade i ett uttalande som efterfrågan på A-aktier kom från företag och privatinvesterare som mestadels köpt säkra banker. Omkring 290.000 Singapore Exchange (SGX) Kina A50 Index futures var också handlas, 45 procent mer än 200.000 kontrakten handlas dagligen i genomsnitt förra veckan. Tidigare kunde investerare endast få direkt exponering för Kina lager via Kina företag som anges i Hong Kong, kallas H-aktier, eller medel på de kvalificerade utländska institutionella investerare (QFII) system. Tan Eng Teck, senior portföljförvaltare på fonden house Nikko AM Asien, sade att den nya länken tillåter fondförvaltare att omplacera sina QFII pengar tidigare investerat i Shanghai-noterade aktier. “Många människor utnyttjar… för att hitta lager inte i Shanghai-Hong Kong ansluta, till exempel på Shenzhen-börsen,” sade han. Således konstaterade lager handel på Shenzhen-börsen på måndagen överträffade dem på andra börser i Kina, han. Under tiden, “söderut” efterfrågan för Hong Kong bestånd från fastlandet var ljum, med knappt 1,8 miljarder av 10,5 miljarder yuan kvoten förbrukats när marknaderna stängda. Rapporter säger att detta var delvis på grund av att privatinvesterare kände de 500.000 yuan minimikapitalkravet att handla Hong Kong aktier var alltför betungande, och att Hong Kong bestånd inte erbjuder tillräcklig diversifiering. Fastlandets kinesiska investerare kan inte heller använda den Hong Kong-börsen som ett sätt att överföra pengar ut.

description663=This article is from British Journal of Cancer , volume 108 . Abstract Background\:\: Inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) signaling pathway have a major role in the treatment of KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer patients. The EGFR pathway has been shown to be activated in gastric cancer (GC). However, published data on KRAS and BRAF mutation status is limited in GC and has not been compared between GC from different geographic regions. Methods\:\: The prevalence of KRAS and BRAF mutations was established in 712 GC\: 278 GC from the United Kingdom, 230 GC from Japan and 204 GC from Singapore. The relationship between KRAS/BRAF mutation status, DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status, clinicopathological variables and overall survival was analysed. Results\:\: Overall, 30 (4.2%) GC carried a KRAS mutation. In total, 5.8% of the UK GC, 4% of Japan GC and 1.5% of Singapore GC were KRAS mutant. KRAS mutant GC had fewer lymph node metastases in the UK cohort (P\=0.005) and were more frequent in elderly patients in the Japan cohort (P\=0.034). KRAS mutations were more frequent in MMR-deficient GC in the UK and the Japanese cohort (P

description658=This study investigates the behavior of university students in Singapore regarding (1) the extent and manner in which they study together outside of class and (2) their perceptions of the quality and value of out-of-class academic collaboration (OCAC). Undergraduates (n\=457) from four different campuses of the National University of Singapore participated. Data were collected via a questionnaire that asked about such areas as places in which students did OCAC, frequency of OCAC, purposes of OCAC, size of OCAC groups, choice of OCAC groupmates, perceived advantages and disadvantages of OCAC, and conditions for promoting successful OCAC. Based on the theoretical literature on learning, the small amount of research on OCAC, and researchers' experiences as teachers and learners at a wide variety of institutions around the world, OCAC is viewed as valuable and should be encouraged. This study is regarded as a logical and necessary first step--the collection of descriptive data on the current state of OCAC. The survey instrument is appended. Numerous tables and charts are included. (Contains 19 references.) (Author/KFT)

description657=This article is from Cancer Biology & Medicine , volume 11 . Abstract Objective\: To provide an overview of the incidence and mortality of female breast cancer for countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods\: Statistical information about breast cancer was obtained from publicly available cancer registry and mortality databases (such as GLOBOCAN), and supplemented with data requested from individual cancer registries. Rates were directly age-standardised to the Segi World Standard population and trends were analysed using joinpoint models. Results\: Breast cancer was the most common type of cancer among females in the region, accounting for 18% of all cases in 2012, and was the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths (9%). Although incidence rates remain much higher in New Zealand and Australia, rapid rises in recent years were observed in several Asian countries. Large increases in breast cancer mortality rates also occurred in many areas, particularly Malaysia and Thailand, in contrast to stabilising trends in Hong Kong and Singapore, while decreases have been recorded in Australia and New Zealand. Mortality trends tended to be more favourable for women aged under 50 compared to those who were 50 years or older. Conclusion\: It is anticipated that incidence rates of breast cancer in developing countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region will continue to increase. Early detection and access to optimal treatment are the keys to reducing breast cancer-related mortality, but cultural and economic obstacles persist. Consequently, the challenge is to customise breast cancer control initiatives to the particular needs of each country to ensure the best possible outcomes.

description652=Innovation, from high profile scientific discoveries to lower profile changes in processes or practices, is crucial to Australia's economic development. However, its impact on the wider community is usually relatively small. Promotion of innovation across all sectors is required to produce the biggest changes. This report focuses on the roles of the vocational education and training (VET) sectors of Finland and Singapore--countries with strong track records in innovation. It argues that a whole-of-government approach supporting a national innovation system could benefit Australia. Further, the national VET sector is ideally placed to have a more direct role in the promotion and diffusion of smaller scale innovations provided incentives in the form of specific funding are put in place. This activity could also enhance the sector's links with business, particularly small to medium sized enterprises and those in regional areas. Appended are\: (1) Finland\: New linkages between vocational education and training and a national innovation system; (2) Singapore\: The high skills path to a knowledge economy; and (3) List of interviewees on Australia's national innovation system and the implications for vocational education and training.

description651=The piloting of a new English language curriculum in Singapore's lower primary and lower secondary school in 1992 is described in three sections\: (1) reasons for revising the existing curriculum; (2) objectives and procedures of the pilot testing; and (3) findings. The existing curriculum, implemented in the early 1980s, was found to be too examination-oriented and recommended no particular teaching method. The new syllabus emphasizes the processes and context of language learning, encourages exploitation of information technology, and provides less highly structured learning objectives. The curriculum is organized around themes supported by meaningful activities through which language skills can be integrated. It was first tested to determine how teachers responded to and used it, and to gain feedback about problems encountered in implementation. The draft syllabus was implemented in a stratified random sampling of 12 schools (six primary and six secondary), with assistance of specialists, and teachers completed a survey about their opinions of the draft syllabus as a document, planning an integrated sequence of lessons based on it, implementation of the lessons, and teacher training and materials development needs. Most teachers responded positively, finding the materials understandable, well-organized, and more interesting and productive in the classroom. Data on questionnaire responses are appended. (MSE)

description648=Recent research suggests the importance of social interaction in facilitating knowledge acquisition and transfer. The theory of mediated learning experience has recently been used to develop a teacher-student interactionist model that is especially applicable to high-risk students. In this model, teachers are involved as mediators in\: (1) producing cognitive change in children; (2) helping children transcend the immediate situation; (3) communicating the meaning and purpose of activities; (4) helping children feel competent; (5) regulating behavior; and (6) communicating the values of sharing and participation. In a pilot study of 4 community tuition centers in Singapore, an experimental group of 52 students received a combination of mediated learning experience and the usual academic program for 4 months, while a control group of the same size received only the academic instruction. Children averaged 11 years of age. All the students were perceived by their teachers to have difficulty in concentrating; to have poor study skills and work habits; and to lack confidence and motivation. The 15 participating tutors attended a workshop on the mediated learning experience philosophy and received supervision and field coaching. Students were tested using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RPM) and the Cognitive Abilities Test (CAT), and a record of class tests in mathematics and English was compiled. Results showed that mediated learning experience classes in three of the four centers performed better on their school tests in mathematics, but that no significant improvement was noted in English, RPM, or CAT scores. Tutors' responses were more encouraging. (AC)

description644=SINGAPORE, October 16 (Fitch) Two deals announced in October by major Indonesian telcos to sell off tower assets to dedicated tower operators will have a varying credit impact for each of the deal participants, says Fitch Ratings. Market leader PT Telkom's plan to sell 49% of subsidiary Mitratel to Tower Bersama (TBI) will be credit neutral for Telkom and positive for TBI. XL Axiata's (Indonesia's third-largest telco) plan to sell 3,500 towers to PT Solusi Tunas Pratama (STP) will be credit positive for XL. The all-equity deal between Telkom and TBI will add about USD125m to TBI's annual revenue and USD70m to EBITDA. TBI's FFO-adjusted net leverage will improve to around 4.0x-4.5x from 5.0x as its annualised last-quarter run-rate EBITDA will rise to USD295m from USD225m, and it will consolidate additional net debt of USD225m to its existing net debt of USD1.2bn on completion of the transaction. TBI's tower portfolio will grow by 35% to 15,194, to emerge as Indonesia's largest independent telecoms tower company. Its operating EBITDAR margin will improve over the medium term as it adds more colocations (the renting/provision of space for other telcos' equipment) on the acquired towers - given their low tenancy ratio of 1.1x.   TBI gains management control of Mitratel, and will also have the option to take 100% ownership by selling another 8% stake in TBI and paying up to USD145m over 10 years to Telkom as Mitratel achieves certain performance milestones. The deal will have only a small dilutive effect on Telkom's profitability, due to higher annual tower rental costs. Telkom will retain a 51% stake in Mitratel, and in exchange receive a 5.7% stake in TBI. The IDR5.6trn (USD460m) proceeds from XL's tower sales to STP will be used to partially repay debt and improve FFO-adjusted net leverage to below 3.0x from 3.5x. XL's leverage rose in 2013 when it bought Indonesia's fifth-largest telco, Axis. It will also benefit from a low fixed-lease rental of IDR10m per month per tower without any additional service fees or inflation escalator as part of the deal - significantly lower rates than the market average. Fitch does not view the XL/STP deal as setting a precedent for tower rental pricing, and should not lead to heightened price competition. In sale and lease-back transactions, low lease rental payments can be offset by larger up-front cash payments, so they do not necessarily act as pricing benchmarks for standard non-sale leasing agreements. This will also not affect existing tenancy contracts of TBI and Protelindo, which have a remaining contract life of 7.2 and 7.4 years, respectively.   Contacts\: Nitin Soni Director Corporates +65 6796 7235 Fitch Ratings Singapore Pte Ltd. \#35-05, Suntec Tower 4 6 Temasek Boulevard Singapore, 038986 Justin Patrie Senior Director +65 6796 7232 Media Relations\: Leslie Tan, Singapore, Tel\: +65 67 96 7234, Email\: leslie.tan@fitchratings.com; Wai-Lun Wan, Hong Kong, Tel\: +852 2263 9935, Email\: wailun.wan@fitchratings.com.

description639=The diffraction pattern of a quasicrystal admits as symmetry group a finite group G, and there exists a G-cluster C (a union of orbits of G) such that the quasicrystal can be regarded as a quasiperiodic packing of copies of C, generally, partially occupied. On the other hand, by starting from the G-cluster C we can define in a canonical way a permutation representation of G in a higher dimensional space, decompose this space into the orthogonal sum of two G-invariant subspaces and use the strip projection method in order to define a pattern which can also be regarded as a quasiperiodic packing of copies of C, generally, partially occupied. This mathematical algorithm is useful in quasicrystal physics, but the dimension of the superspace we have to use in the case of a two or three-shell cluster is rather large. We show that the generalization concerning the strip projection method proposed by Baake and Moody [Proc. Int. Conf. Aperiodic' 97 (Alpe d'Huez, 27-31 August, 1997) ed M de Boissieu et al. (Singapore\: World Scientific, 1999) pp 9-20] allows to reduce this dimension, and present some examples.

description637=This article is from Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene , volume 107 . Abstract Background\: Previously, most dengue cases in Singapore were hospitalized despite low incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or death. To minimize hospitalization, the Communicable Disease Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Singapore implemented new admission criteria which included clinical, laboratory, and DHF predictive parameters in 2007. Method\: All laboratory-confirmed dengue patients seen at TTSH during 2006–2008 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical data. Disease outcome and clinical parameters were compared over the 3 years. Results\: There was a 33.0% mean decrease in inpatients after the new criteria were implemented compared with the period before (p < 0.001). The proportion of inpatients with DHF increased significantly from 31.7% in 2006 to 34.4% in 2008 (p \= 0.008); 68 DHF cases were managed safely on an outpatient basis after compared with none before implementation. DHF inpatients had more serious signs such as clinical fluid accumulation (15.5% vs 2.9% of outpatients), while most DHF outpatients had hypoproteinemia (92.7% vs 81.3% of inpatients). The eight intensive care unit admissions and five deaths during this time period all occurred among inpatients. The new criteria resulted in a median cost saving of US$1.4 million to patients in 2008. Conclusion\: The new dengue admission criteria were effective in sustainably reducing length of hospitalization, yielding considerable cost savings. A minority of DHF patients with mild symptoms recovered uneventfully through outpatient management.

description631=Background\: Data were collected in Singapore as part of a ten-country international study that focuses on cross-cultural comparison of principal attitudes towards teacher involvement. Aim\: This paper presents secondary school principals' perceptions with regard to teachers' responsibility-taking in the context of school change in Singapore. Sample\: Fifty-two secondary school principals in Singapore. Method\: A survey instrument consisting of twenty scaled sub-sectioned questions. Results\: Three features emerge from the Singapore perspective. Firstly, school principals in Singapore believed that teachers should have a relatively high level of involvement. Secondly, in comparison to the others, principals in Singapore were relatively hesitant to involve their teachers. Thirdly, there was no significant difference in their perception of teacher involvement in the thematic clusters of human relations and teacher support. Conclusion\: Knowledge, understanding and sensitivity to the perceptions of principals could facilitate professional collaboration in the service of contribution to education. (Contains 4 tables.)

description623=The purpose of this paper was to examine the cross-national performance of fourth- and eighth-grade students in mathematics on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2003. The TIMSS assessment data were used to identify nations that have a competitive edge in the critical area of mathematics. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is an ambitious international assessment that provides comparative data on student achievement among participating countries and benchmarking jurisdictions. TIMSS 2003 assessed the mathematics knowledge of more that 360,000 fourth- and eighth-grade students in participating countries in the 2002-2003 school year. Data were collected from students in the countries in the southern hemisphere from September-November, 2002. In countries in the northern hemisphere, data were collected from February-July, 2003. TIMSS 2003 provides an array of data that may be analyzed and used to frame policy guidelines in education, especially in teaching and learning of mathematics. Data analyses portrayed interesting findings. Data from TIMSS 2003 showed that fourth-grade students in Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Chinese Taipei, and Belgium-Flemish outperformed the world. At the eighth-grade, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, Japan, and Belgium-Flemish outsmarted the world. The following recommendations, among others, may be of benefit to low performing countries in improving the achievement of their students in mathematics\: (1) Low-performing nations should make their teacher education admission, curriculum, graduation, and certification requirements more challenging to teacher education candidates; (2) Teacher education programs should be designed with a fifth year post certification internship. During the internship, novice teachers will be gradually introduced to the teaching profession. This is obtained in medical and some other health professions. Teaching is critical as the medical profession; (3) Teacher education systems should establish new teacher induction and support programs. These induction and support programs should include seminars and workshops, mentoring, observing veteran teachers in classrooms, team teaching, peer interactions, lighter teaching load, and assignment to less challenging classrooms. New teacher induction and support programs should be used as a means of reducing new teacher attrition rate, thereby increasing teacher retention. (Contains 2 tables.)
description622=A study recorded the experiences of elementary school students with cooperative learning in two schools in Singapore. The students worked cooperatively in various assigned social studies tasks through the process of social interaction and sharing with their peers. One school was used as the experimental school while the other served as the control; four classes were chosen from each school. These experiences were captured through taped group discussions and interviews conducted with groups of pupils. A detailed analysis of their conversations documents some of the group processes and learning settings that seemed to affect group behaviors, motivation, and satisfaction of working together in cooperative groups. The quality of talk differed between the high and lower ability pupils. Different strategies were used by the two groups of pupils to process different types of tasks. In their interactions, they displayed different helping behaviors. Preliminary findings seem to indicate that personal gains, especially from the academic perspective, were an important determinant of participation in group interaction in the Singapore school context. The two groups of pupils also employed different social skills in their interactions. They differed in their ways of negotiating social relationships and coping with barriers to group cohesiveness. Findings suggest that the cooperative learning strategy has tremendous potential in helping lower ability pupils improve their learning and academic performance in social studies. Contains a table of data and 21 references. (BT)

description618=This study examined the value orientation of Singapore adolescents toward the three fundamental values of truthfulness, justice, and compassion. A random sample of 315 secondary school students from 4 schools in Singapore (135 males and 180 females) completed a questionnaire, and a select sample of 19 students completed interviews about their perspectives and orientation toward truthfulness, justice, and compassion. The study also examined the effects of family, school, daily activities (including social activities), and the mass media on the values of the adolescents, and it noted gender differences related to value orientation. Each value orientation was tested on three moral concepts. Truthfulness focused on sincerity, honesty, and promise keeping. Justice focused on moral rightness, equity, and fairness. Compassion focused on mercy, care and concern, and benevolence. The questionnaires and interviews asked students to make moral judgements about certain scenarios. Analysis of the data obtained from both the survey and interviews revealed the following\: Singapore adolescents were generally truthful, just, and compassionate, but if caught in a moral dilemma of choice between truthfulness and compassion, most showed little or no compassion; families and schools significantly affected the adolescents' fundamental value orientation. Students spent about 3-4 hours daily with television and newspapers; and females were more compassionate than males, but both sexes were equally truthful and just. (Contains 75 references.) (SM)

description611=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 8 . Abstract Background\: Gastric cancer (GC) surveillance based on oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) appears to be a promising strategy for GC prevention. By evaluating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance in Singaporean Chinese, this study aimed to inform the implementation of such a program in a population with a low to intermediate GC risk. Methods\: Using a reference strategy of no OGD intervention, we evaluated four strategies\: 2-yearly OGD surveillance, annual OGD surveillance, 2-yearly OGD screening and 2-yearly screening plus annual surveillance in Singaporean Chinese aged 50-69 years. From a perspective of the healthcare system, Markov models were built to simulate the life experience of the target population. The models projected discounted lifetime costs ($), quality adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating the cost-effectiveness of each strategy against a Singapore willingness-to-pay of $46,200/QALY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to identify the influential variables and their associated thresholds, and to quantify the influence of parameter uncertainties respectively. Results\: With an ICER of $44,098/QALY, the annual OGD surveillance was the optimal strategy while the 2-yearly surveillance was the most cost-effective strategy (ICER  \=  $25,949/QALY). The screening-based strategies were either extendedly dominated or cost-ineffective. The cost-effectiveness heterogeneity of the four strategies was observed across age-gender subgroups. Eight influential parameters were identified each with their specific thresholds to define the choice of optimal strategy. Accounting for the model uncertainties, the probability that the annual surveillance is the optimal strategy in Singapore was 44.5%. Conclusion\: Endoscopic surveillance is potentially cost-effective in the prevention of GC for populations at low to intermediate risk. Regarding program implementation, a detailed analysis of influential factors and their associated thresholds is necessary. Multiple strategies should be considered in order to recommend the right strategy for the right population.
description610=Some surface level stuff about the Grimaldi chapter of the satanic royalty and its network of gangster states that it hides its wealth in. The Judaeo-Masonic British-Israel Beast empire has many of these prominent outposts like Switzerland, the area of the Bahamas, Lichtenstein, Singapore, Hong Kong, Isle of Jersey, a lot in South America and other havens for money laundering, tax evasion, covert support of terrorist movements and drug empire management. It's said that Grace Kelly, a real witch from Pennsylvania and hollywood harpy, was actually assassinated because the Grimaldis were skimming too much from the drug shipments that regularly travel through the waters of Monaco and the extensive laundering thereof that happens in the kingdom. Monaco, like all small kingdoms, keeps its independence because of bribery and blackmail, many top elites have accounts in these cess pools themselves and want to keep them available for themselves. These are also big satanist places as this is the religion that goes best with this activity. Lots of Judaeo-Masonic activity and intelligence service(which are judaeo-masonic wholly) shenanigans.

description607=This article is from BMC Public Health , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: The study aimed to establish the prevalence of heavy drinking, evaluate correlations between heavy drinking and socio-demographic factors, physical and psychiatric conditions, and assess the impact of heavy drinking on quality of life and days of work-loss. Methods\: Data from a nationally-representative cross-sectional sample were used. The sample comprised 6616 community-dwelling Singaporeans & Singapore Permanent Residents. The main instruments used were the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview and EuroQol 5D. Heavy drinking was defined as consumption of 4 or more drinks, or 5 or more drinks in a day in women and men respectively. Results\: 12.6% of all adult Singapore residents reported heavy drinking in the last 12 months, and 15.9% reported lifetime heavy-drinking. Strong gender, ethnic, age and income differences were seen. Heavy drinking was positively associated with major depression, the presence of any mood disorder, and with chronic pain. It was also strongly associated with alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse, and nicotine dependence. Heavy-drinkers reported lower quality of life compared to non-heavy drinkers, measured using the EuroQol 5D Visual Analogue Scale. Conclusions\: Singapore has a relatively high prevalence of 12-month heavy drinking of 12.6%, and lifetime heavy drinking of 15.9%. Heavy drinking was positively associated with both physical and mental health conditions, and with declines in quality of life. Continued monitoring of heavy drinking behavior and sustained efforts to mitigate the risks associated with heavy drinking is needed.

description606=Vocational and technical training in Singapore has a relatively short history. Only after Singapore became independent did the need to formalize a national system of training to support the labor force needs of industrialization become evident. Singapore's first vocational institute was established in 1964. The system has experienced several significant phases of development, the most recent being the upgrading of vocational training to a postsecondary institution under the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) in 1992. Among the ITE's principal functions are the following\: preemployment training for secondary school leavers; full-time institutional training; apprenticeship training; continuing education and training for working adults; worker education; worker skills training; industry-based training; customized skills training; certified on-the-job training (OJT) through the Certified OJT Training Centre Scheme; and responsibility for conducting national certification and public trade tests. Singapore's vocational and technical training system faces a number of challenges and constraints. The major factors shaping technical education and training in Singapore are as follows\: the country's limited natural and human resources; the declining rate of growth of the work force; large numbers of older workers with lower levels of education and skills; increasing global competitiveness; and the continual upgrading and restructuring of the country's industries.

description605=Secondary-level technology programs in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan (also known as the "Four Little Dragons") were compared by using a methodology incorporating four stages\: description, interpretation, juxtaposition, and comparison. It was discovered that, in all four countries, technology education is required for all students in the lower secondary grades (grades 7-9) and offered on an elective basis to students in the upper secondary grades (grades 10-12). A trend toward increasing incorporation of information technology into technology education was noted in all four countries. Emphasis on higher-order thinking skills and the role of problem solving in the design process also appeared to be increasing in all four countries. Among the common problems faced by all four countries in the implementation of technology education were the following\: lack of qualified teachers and adequate equipment; insufficient financial support and teaching hours; and out-of-date curricula. More dialogue among technology educators from Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan is necessary. All four countries' chances of fostering technology education are good provided they engage in ongoing and systematic curriculum development and effective professional supervision. (MN)
description604=A naturally formed spherical pearl was recently discovered in a Tegillarca granosa (Linnaeus, 1758), which was purchased from a market in Singapore , and herein reported. This is probably the first published report of a spherical pearl from Tegillarca granosa . The cause of pearl formation remains unknown.
description603=This cross-cultural study, utilizing a structured instructional behavior rating form, examined distinguishing and comparable teaching practices in secondary gifted classrooms in Singapore and the United States. Teachers from Singapore (n \= 67) and teachers from the United States (n \= 33) in 5 subject domains including math, science, English, social studies, and second language were observed. The study showed that Singapore teachers demonstrated a higher level of effectiveness than American teachers in both general teacher behaviors and differentiation strategies. The level of instructional effectiveness appeared to be positively related to the number of years of teaching experience and training in differentiation practices for the gifted. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables and 2 end notes.)
description602=Background\: The concept of humility invariably emerges as part of serendipitous findings in the limited research conducted in Singapore that pertains to this area. There has not been subsequent significant academic research in the local context since the nineties with regard to the seemingly insignificant notion of humility. It is under such a context that the authors attempt to explore the notion in a pilot study. Aims\: To investigate the notion of humility as perceived by school leaders in Singapore and to determine whether humility is deemed a strength or a weakness among these leaders. This paper also attempts to surface the probable incorporation of the concept of humility in the development and delivery of leadership programs in Singapore. Sample\: A sample of fourteen school leaders in Singapore were requested to share their perceptions in this pilot study. Thirteen responses (93%) were usable. Method\: A survey was conducted and the open-ended written responses received from the school leaders were analyzed. Results\: The results reveal five features that could be associated with the school leaders' perception of humility, namely, self-awareness, open-mindedness, admitting mistakes, generosity in sharing, as well as recognizing and promoting the deserving. Conclusion\: Aspects of the notions of humility as identified pertain to the practice of school management learned through mentoring; the mentoring by worthy role models in education. It is advocated that program delivery of leadership take into cognizance the deliberate incorporation of the concept of humility as part of school leadership development.

description600=A study investigated the distribution of post-vocalic /r/ in Singapore English as it may relate to social factors, particularly whether usage appears to be perceived as a prestige feature by those who use it. Informants were 21 subjects from various social backgrounds. Three speech styles representing a range of stylistic variation were elicited\: subjects were interviewed, read a passage aloud, and read a word list. Frequency of post-vocalic /r/ use in each speech style was calculated, and subjects were ranked by frequency. The effects of other variables (age, gender, peer group influence, self-consciousness) and the phenomenon of hypercorrection were also examined. It is concluded that (r) is a sociolinguistic variable in this group, with post-vocalic /r/ seen as a prestige feature for some speakers. A sound change may also be occurring, with increased frequency of general usage predicted. The reading passage, word list, and data on individual usage patterns are appended. A 14-item bibliography is included. (MSE)

description598=This article is from BMC Microbiology , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: Capsular serotypes K1 and K2 of Klebsiella pneumoniae are thought to the major virulence determinants responsible for liver abscess. The intestine is one of the major reservoirs of K. pneumoniae, and epidemiological studies have suggested that the majority of K. pneumoniae infections are preceded by colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of fecal-oral transmission in liver abscess has been raised on the basis of molecular typing of isolates. Data on the serotype distribution of K. pneumoniae in stool samples from healthy individuals has not been previously reported. This study investigated the seroepidemiology of K. pneumoniae isolates from the intestinal tract of healthy Chinese in Asian countries. Stool specimens from healthy adult Chinese residents of Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam were collected from August 2004 to August 2010 for analysis. Results\: Serotypes K1/K2 accounted for 9.8% of all K. pneumoniae isolates from stools in all countries. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of K1/K2 isolates among the countries excluding Thailand and Vietnam. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was nearly the same in K. pneumoniae isolates. The result of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed no major clonal cluster of serotype K1 isolates. Conclusions\: The result showed that Chinese ethnicity itself might be a major factor predisposing to intestinal colonization by serotype K1/K2 K. pneumoniae isolates. The prevalent serotype K1/K2 isolates may partially correspond to the prevalence of K. pneumoniae liver abscess in Asian countries.

description596=This article is from Journal of Foot and Ankle Research , volume 6 . Abstract Background\: The growing ageing population and high prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in athletes across nations have created a strong demand for improved non-invasive therapeutic alternatives for knee OA. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the variable stiffness shoe (VSS), a new non-invasive therapeutic approach, on external knee adduction moment (EKAM) in various dynamic exercises. EKAM is believed to have positive correlation with the progression and development of knee OA. Methods\: Thirty young participants (16 male and 14 female; age 22.6 ± 1.9 years) from National University of Singapore were enrolled in this study. The tested activities were walking, running, drop-landing, and lateral hopping. All the dynamic exercises were recorded simultaneously by the 8-camera VICON Motion Systems (Oxford Metric, UK) with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. Results\: The results showed that the EKAM was reduced in all the dynamic exercises with the use of VSS. The VSS produced significant reductions in the peak EKAM during walking (4.97%, p \= 0.039), running (11.15%, p \= 0.011), drop-landing (11.18%, p \= 0.038) and lateral hopping (17.34%, p \= 0.023) as compared to the control shoe. Conclusions\: The reduction of EKAM with the use of VSS in various dynamic exercises demonstrates its potential in delaying the onset and the progression of knee OA in early stage of knee OA patients.

description595=The United States' education system needs to take its critical next step\: fairly and accurately measuring teacher performance. Successful reforms to teacher pay, career advancement, professional development, retention, and other human capital systems that lead to better student outcomes depend on it. Where can the U.S. find the best-practice know-how for this? To start, it should look to nations that have revamped teacher performance measurement to sustain teaching excellence, and Singapore offers a remarkable example. In the early 2000s, the small but racially and economically diverse nation of Singapore designed and implemented a new, performance-linked method of measuring teacher effectiveness that enables measurement of teachers in all subjects and grades. Singapore had already developed a high-performing education system. But as global economic opportunities for its citizens increased, it needed to ensure continued recruitment, retention, and performance of talented teachers. Today, Singapore's students consistently perform at the top of internationally comparable exams, and 98 percent of Singapore's sixth-grade students achieve math standards more rigorous than the eighth-grade standards on the U.S. NAEP exam (National Assessment of Educational Progress). What can the United States learn from Singapore? Much, it seems, and Singapore knows it. The complete recipe for its educational success is not public, and determining the ingredients in the secret sauce is a challenge. But one element stands out\: the development and thorough use of performance-linked "competencies" to measure, reward, and develop teacher performance. This paper presents a brief background on the state of teacher evaluation in the United States, the case for why the country can learn much from Singapore, and key facts about Singapore's competency-based teacher evaluation system.

description594=This article is from Frontiers in Pediatrics , volume 2 . Abstract Aim\: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents the most severe form of acute lung injury. The aim of our study is to describe the epidemiology of pediatric ARDS in Singapore and compare the outcomes of ARDS using the following respiratory indices\: PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio), SpO2/FiO2 ratio (S/F ratio), oxygenation index (OI), and oxygen saturation index (OSI).Methods\: We examined medical records of patients admitted to the Children’s Intensive Care Unit in KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital from 2009 to 2012. Those who fulfilled criteria for the American-European Consensus Conference definition for ARDS were identified. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic information were extracted and analyzed.Results\: We identified 70 patients with ARDS. Median age (interquartile range) was 6.2 (1.4, 10.4) years. The most common risk factor was pneumonia [50 (71%)]. Overall mortality was 44 (63%) patients. Thirty-two (56%) patients had an underlying chronic comorbidity; 18 (46%) were hematology–oncology conditions. Fifty-six (80%) patients had multiorgan dysfunction. Adjunct therapies used in our patients included inhaled nitric oxide [5 (7%)], prone position [22 (31%)], steroids [26 (37%)], and neuromuscular blockade [26 (37%)]. A high OI and low PF ratio after 24 h of diagnosis of ARDS were associated with mortality. From day 3 onward, all four respiratory indices appropriately differentiated survivors from non-survivors. Severity based on the S/F ratio and OSI demonstrated association with decreased ventilator free days and ICU free days.Conclusion\: Risk factors for mortality included having an underlying comorbidity, multiorgan dysfunction, a low PF ratio, and high OI at 24 h of ARDS. Abnormal SpO2-based measurements were reliable markers of poor outcomes in pediatric ARDS.

description593=This article is from BMC Research Notes , volume 6 . Abstract Background\: The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of education about sleep and sleep disorders in pediatric residency programs and to identify barriers to providing such education. Methods\: Surveys were completed by directors of 152 pediatric residency programs across 10 countries (Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, United States-Canada, and Vietnam). Results\: Overall, the average amount of time spent on sleep education is 4.4 hours (median \= 2.0 hours), with 23% responding that their pediatric residency program provides no sleep education. Almost all programs (94.8%) offer less than 10 hours of instruction. The predominant topics covered include sleep-related development, as well as normal sleep, sleep-related breathing disorders, parasomnias, and behavioral insomnia of childhood. Conclusions\: These results indicate that there is still a need for more efforts to include sleep-related education in all pediatric residency programs, as well as coverage of the breadth of sleep-related topics. Such education would be consistent with the increased recognition of the importance of sleep and under-diagnosis of sleep disorders in children and adolescents.

description591=As Jim Cramer of CNBC's Mad Money always says\: "There's always a bull market somewhere." In the spirit of that bullish way of viewing markets in both good and not-so-good times, here are 10 investment ideas that panelists from USA TODAY's 2016 Investment Roundtable say can help you build a winning portfolio in 2016. 1. FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL STOCKS . If David Kostin of Goldman Sachs is right and the broad S&P 500 stock index posts flat returns next year, owning an index fund that tracks and mimics the performance of the large-company stock gauge may not be the most profitable strategy. To increase your odds of posting double-digit percentage gains next year, pinpoint individual names that have what it takes to outperform the S&P 500. "Stock picking will become much more important," says Kostin, who favors growth stocks with strong balance sheets and companies that the bulk of their revenues domestically. 2. LOOK BEYOND FANTASTIC 'FANG' STOCKS \: Tech stocks Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google got so hot, so hyped and so dominant that they earned the acronym "FANG" stocks. The big four also posted big gains this year — so sizable, in fact, that they were responsible for most, if not all, of the gains in the market-cap weighted Nasdaq composite. Next year, however, tech leadership is not likely to be as narrow, says Josh Spencer, manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund. "I think the tech market will broaden next year," he says, adding that tech names that will benefit from the cyclical uptick in the economy will get a fresh look from Wall Street. Examples include companies that make semiconductors and semiconductor equipment and which are breaking into new growth areas, such as high-tech gadgetry now found in the modern auto fleet. 3. REJECT USA BIAS AND GO GLOBAL . The U.S. stock market faces a host of headwinds — such as coming interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, a strong dollar and full valuations, to name a few — that could limit gains in 2016. Those domestic obstacles bolster the case for putting more cash to work in foreign stock markets, such as Europe and Japan where central bankers are more market-friendly and valuations are less pricey, says Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. "There are certain headwinds in the U.S. that are actually tailwinds in other parts of the world," Koesterich says. "In terms of valuations, I don't think we are in bubble territory, but U.S. valuations are a bit stretched. They are less stretched in Europe and Japan."

description588=This article is from BMC Public Health , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: South Asian children with asthma are less likely to receive prescriptions and more likely to suffer uncontrolled symptoms and acute asthma admissions compared with White British children. Understanding barriers are therefore vital in addressing health inequalities. We undertook a systematic review identifying explanatory factors for barriers and facilitators to asthma management in South Asian children. South Asians were defined as individuals of Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi descent. Methods\: Data Sources - Medline, HMIC, EMBASE, ASSIA, Web of Science, BNI, CINAHL, PsycINFO, OpenSIGLE, CRD, Scopus, NHS Evidence, Cochrane Library, Campbell Collaboration, RCPCH, ATS, ERS, Asthma UK, Google Scholar & Asthma Guidelines (BTS, GINA, ATS, Monash, NAEPP, Singapore & New Zealand) to August 2013.Inclusion Criteria – Qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods research with primary focus on identifying explanations for barriers and/or facilitators to asthma management in South Asian children aged 0–18 years with diagnosed/suspected asthma and/or carers and/or healthcare professionals.Data Extraction – Three authors independently reviewed, selected & extracted eligible articles with disagreements resolved by research team discussion. Results\: 15 studies encompassing 25,755 children, 18,483 parents/carers and 239 healthcare professionals were included. Barriers and explanatory factors identified were\:1. Lack of asthma knowledge in families and healthcare professionals.2. Under-use of preventer medications.3. Non-acceptance/denial of asthma.4. Over-reliance on Emergency Department management.5. Communication problems.6. Non-adherence to medication.7. Use of complementary therapies.Little facilitators regarding asthma management were identified. Conclusions\: Several key issues were identified as likely to be ethnic-specific to South Asian families, rather than a reflection of minority status\: impact of parental and professional knowledge and beliefs, health service utilisation pattern explanations and the impact of prejudice and stigmatisation. Other explanations such as language barriers are not strictly ethnic specific but instead reflect a minority position.Further research is required to identify why barriers exist, the mechanisms by which they impact on asthma management and how they can be overcome. Furthermore, understanding the difference between barriers and explanations that are ethnic-specific and those that are related to being a minority will enable the application of generic system-wide interventions where ethnicity is not the issue and ethnically-tailored interventions where needed.

description580=Singapore, a small island city-state, has achieved notable economic advancement within 40 years since independence. It is fast becoming a global city and a knowledge society. In education and training, the Singapore system has evolved from its British roots. Macro performance indicators of participation rate, literacy rate and mean years of schooling, show that the current education system can be regarded as highly successful. The contributions of general education as well as technical education and training to the overall success of the nation are often cited. Technical education and training, which is globally perceived as having a lower status than "academic" curricula, has largely overcome its "image" problem in Singapore. Singaporeans have seemingly embraced technical education and training as an accessible, attractive mode of education, which therefore enjoys a high participation rate. The success and quality of technical education and training were affirmed when its main provider, the Institute of Technical Education, became the first educational institution in Singapore to win the Singapore Quality Award in October 2005. This paper provides a review of the contemporary education system and curriculum in Singapore with a focus on technical education and training vis-a-vis a vision of education and training in and for postmodern knowledge societies. Suggestions are made on how the technical education and training sector in Singapore can further develop and thrive in the 21st century, while continuing to be accessible and of high quality.

description579=Background\: The mission of our education service as stated by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore\: "is to mould the future of the nation, by moulding the people who will decide the future of the nation. The aim is to provide our children with a balanced and well-rounded education, develop them to their full potential, and nurture them into good citizens, aware of their responsibilities to family, society and country" (MOE, 2004). We want to develop the child morally, intellectually, physically, socially and aesthetically (MOE, 2004). In short, our Desired Outcomes of Education aim to foster a holistic child through a holistic education system. Comments\: Although there are lots of concern and emphasis on holistic education in the teaching of all the various curricular subjects, there are little or no substantial elements of holistic learning in second language learning and teaching, in specific, Chinese language. The absence of holism in Chinese language learning hints that our Chinese pedagogy has yet to develop a holistic child in Chinese language learning. Aim\: To address this issue, this paper attempts to construct a model framework promoting holism in Chinese language learning. The constructed framework will incorporate the Philosophy for Children (P4C) approach as a means through which to practice holistic education in Chinese language learning. Conclusion\: The fundamental concern of someone who uses a language is making sense. For students learning a language, holistic learning is crucial to forming an understanding of the world. A holistic learning of the language would treat the learner as a legitimate conversation partner and someone who seeks meaning. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)

description578=Academic collaboration among students takes place not only inside the classrooms but outside of class as well. This study investigated such out-of-class academic collaboration among Singaporean polytechnic students as they worked on assignments in which their instructors had made collaboration mandatory. Data were collected via questionnaires completed by 232 students, interviews were conducted with 10 instructors, and observations were done on 8 student groups as they collaborated on mandatory out-of-class collaborative assignments. Variables of interest included frequency of out-of-class collaboration (very frequent), how such work is assessed (usually a combination of group and individual grading), group size (most often 4 or 5), who decides on group composition (usually the students), and factors students and teachers believe contribute to successful group work (e.g., keeping focused, allocating work, and sharing ideas). Suggestions are made on how to guide students to make greater and more efficient use of group study outside of class (e.g., team-building activities and training in group skills) and to help instructors gain new ideas for organizing and facilitating out-of-class academic collaboration among their students (such as conferences with groups to help them structure their collaboration). The student questionnaire and teacher interview questions are appended. (Contains 36 references.) (KFT)

description577=Two aspects of a 9-year research study initiated in July 1983 by the Singapore Institute of Education are described. The first part describes the initial 3-year phase of a longitudinal study aimed at investigating some important cognitive and social developmental processes of preschool children at different ages and relating them to certain intervention strategies that attempt to enhance their cognitive and social competencies. Cognitive growth, social behavior, home and school environments, and the relationships among these factors were studied for 2,418 3- to 6.5-year-old children (1,211 males and 1,207 females) who completed all of the study measures. The second aspect is a recent follow-up pilot investigation of how these cognitive and social developmental processes are related to gender differences across 4 age groups from age 3 to 6 years. Subjects were 171 Chinese preschoolers (84 males and 87 females) from a private kindergarten in Singapore. Developmental trends that the children exhibited in both studies are discussed. In all age groups, females performed better than did males at language and social skills, and males were more successful in the mathematics tests than were females. Nine tables and seven figures present study details. (SLD)

description576=In August 2010 Singapore bike club Team 27 organized a fly-ride big bike tour from Beijing to Shanghai with the support of a Chinese travel agency. The ride was 1740 km in 14 Days. 28 bikes were shipped from Singapore, roughly 1/3 BMW, 1/3 Harley-Davidson, 1/3 Japanese, and one Ducati. The bikes were shipped by ocean freight to Beijing then back to Singapore from Shanghai. The cost was US$470 per day. In China the bikes had to follow in convoy behind a minivan which carried the Chinese travel agents who dealt with toll booths, highway police, and other en-route logistics. An intercity tourist coach and a truck for disabled bikes followed behind the convoy; by the end of the tour, two Harleys and the Ducati would break down and be rolled into the truck. All riding had to be on pre-approved expressways and major highways and all hotels and motorcycle parking had to be in remote suburban areas away from the local population.

description575=The economic openness between nations die certainly to the occurrence of economic development in the same countries as the increasing exports and reducing imports, economic target for each country to increase its economic resources and increase economic growth has and consequently an increase in per capita income, which is reflected on the improvement and welfare of the community and helping to overcome the economic and social problems, One of the main subjects of the Pure Theory of International Trade has been the study of Comparative Advantage, that is, the determination of trade patterns. Ricardo focused on relative cost differences based on technology, whereas the conventional Heckscher-Ohlin model shows that even with identical technologies and constant returns, relative costs can differ if factor proportions differ, Adam Smith was probably the first one to consider the effects of market size on specialization and therefore on volumes exchanged. The theory of commercial policy also establishes a relation between protection and volume of trade, and the researchers suggest  that trade to GDP ratios are market determined variables subject to conventional theoretical analysis and empirical verification, This paper I shall use the ratio D.OP\={(Exports/Imports)x100} as the measure for openness of the economy to countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippine and Thailand  then compare  with each other to gain access to the state the most open and influential in the economy The cause of calculate openness in this way unlike calculating some which combines imports and exports and then divides the result by the gross domestic product to become ratio represents the degree of openness, but cannot measure this degree on economic growth and on economic indicators as is the proportion as in economic sectors that are also a certain percentage and so I would suggest this solution to indicate the degree of economic openness are then estimated using regression models the effect of the degree of economic openness on GDP growth.

description569=This article is from Health Policy and Planning , volume 26 . Abstract The objective of this empirical study was to understand the perspectives and attitudes of policy-makers towards the use and impact of research in the health sector in low- and middle-income countries. The study used data from 83 semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted with purposively selected policy-makers at the national level in Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Malawi, Oman and Singapore. The interviews were structured around an interview guide developed based on existing literature and in consultation with all six country investigators. Transcripts were processed using a thematic-analysis approach. Policy-makers interviewed for this study were unequivocal in their support for health research and the high value they attribute to it. However, they stated that there were structural and informal barriers to research contributing to policy processes, to the contribution research makes to knowledge generally, and to the use of research in health decision-making specifically. Major findings regarding barriers to evidence-based policy-making included poor communication and dissemination, lack of technical capacity in policy processes, as well as the influence of the political context. Policy-makers had a variable understanding of economic analysis, equity and burden of disease measures, and were vague in terms of their use in national decisions. Policy-maker recommendations regarding strategies for facilitating the uptake of research into policy included improving the technical capacity of policy-makers, better packaging of research results, use of social networks, and establishment of fora and clearinghouse functions to help assist in evidence-based policy-making.

description567=We present a model of dark energy based on the string effective action, and on the assumption that the dilaton is strongly coupled to dark matter. We discuss the main differences between this class of models and more conventional models of quintessence,uncoupled to dark matter. This paper is based on talks presented at the "VII Congresso Nazionale di Cosmologia" (Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma, Monte Porzio Catone, November 2002), and at the Meeting "Dark Energy Day" (University of Milano-Bicocca, November 2002).

description566=A possible resolution of the incompatibility of quantum mechanics and general relativity is that the relativity principle is emergent. I show that the central paradox of black holes also occurs at a liquid-vapor critical surface of a bose condensate but is resolved there by the phenomenon of quantum criticality. I propose that real black holes are actually phase boundaries of the vacuum analogous to this, and that the Einstein field equations simply fail at the event horizon the way quantum hydrodynamics fails at a critical surface. This can occur without violating classical general relativity anywhere experimentally accessible to external observers. Since the low-energy effects that occur at critical points are universal, it is possible to make concrete experimental predictions about such surfaces without knowing much, if anything about the true underlying equations. Many of these predictions are different from accepted views about black holes - in particular the absence of Hawking radiation and the possible transparency of cosmological black hole surfaces.

This study investigated the effects of variations in the day care environment on linguistic and social-emotional development of preschool children in Singapore in order to answer the following questions\: (1) Are there environmental differences in day care centers in Singapore? (2) How are differences in characteristics of the day care environment related to children's linguistic and social-emotional development? (3) What are the effects of day care quality on children's development after taking home background into account? The subjects were 122 children, ages 49 to 72 months, enrolled in full-day care and randomly selected from 16 centers. Subjects completed pre- and posttests consisting of academic, linguistic, and social-emotional assessments. The results indicated that center quality and specific subscales as measured by the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS) predict some linguistic and social-emotional outcomes of children.

description562=Iedereen die heeft gewerkt in een bank, of een particuliere onderneming, voor die kwestie, weet hoe werk kan nemen op een grote tol op iemands leven en de gezondheid. Een vijf-dag-per-week, acht-uur-a-dag werk-en-neen-plezier-binnen kan praktisch afvoer uit het leven sappen tenzij een stopcontact heeft in evenwicht uit de vergelijking een of andere manier. Maar zou het niet geweldig zijn als werk had al het plezier binnen om te komen uit het slagveld nog steeds lachend en enthousiast om te doen een andere dag strijd de volgende dag? Dit lijkt misschien te idealistisch of fantasievolle voor sommige; maar een bedrijf, zoals de Keeley Consulting Group , is eigenlijk al doen. All-business of all-werk-en-no-fun aanspreekt niet langer in de moderne zakenwereld als het altijd heeft gehad in het verleden. Zakelijke leiders weten wat mensen op zoek naar in hun leven en in hun banen en bieden de mogelijkheden voor mensen om zich te uiten meer volledig in hun werk neemt niets meer dan het verstrekken van het evenwicht dat ze nodig hebben en zoekt u in andere gebieden van hun leven. Zeldzaam hoewel het lijkt misschien voor mensen of bedrijven in het bedrijfsleven om te spreken van werk en plezier in één adem, is het een belangrijk beginsel dat is verwaarloosd voor zo lang. Bereiken van evenwicht is een natuurlijke wet dat wij mensen niet kunnen breken zonder te verstoren de essentiële cycli die nastreven van volgorde en succes in ons leven en binnen onze gemeenschappen. Dus, hoe we dit evenwicht bereiken? Vaak, zijn mensen zo gefocust op het heden zonder gehinderd te worden door wat er in de toekomst kan gebeuren. Workaholics geneigd te denken dat werk het primaire ding is terwijl te vergeten dat werk een middel naar een groter doel is; dat biedt mogelijkheden voor de meerderheid van de mensen om te genieten van het leven de manier waarop het moet worden genoten – Ja, zelfs terwijl u werkt, niet alleen nadat u klaar bent met uw werk. Fabrieken waardoor speelgoed moeten wees de eerste om het plezier en de sensatie van het maken van speelgoed in plaats van de sweatshops die veel zou kunnen aan hen denken te vertonen. Stel je voor Santa's Elfen lui en unsmilingly werken om te verslaan van oude Saint Nick kerstavond termijn alsof ze onderbetaald, slapeloze slaven. Wat voor soort echte pret zou die brengen aan de kinderen en zelfs volwassenen van deze wereld? Nou, als vrolijke op het werk kan worden gevraagd te veel van de werknemers; maar het kon doen een hoop goed als we de helft van Santa's plezier op het werk hadden, vooral als het helpt om te maken werken moeite waard, en als een resultaat, efficiënter. Opleiding van mensen om te kijken op het werk en vinden van manieren om evenwicht te bereiken is juist een van de uitdagingen die de Keeley Consulting Group aan de deelnemers van de opleiding. Uiteindelijk, is het de persoon die hoe bepalen kan om dat evenwicht in iemands werkleven. Het is een kwestie van de juiste houding het evenwicht tussen werk en plezier in de specifieke omstandigheden van een bepaalde zakelijke omgeving te vinden. Men moet beseffen dat dit evenwicht dat wij streven naar niet een product van cultuur of van trial-and-error is. Het vloeit voort uit de ontwikkeling van iemands gevoeligheid voor de mogelijkheden die toestaan dat een persoon om de eisen van iemands werk (wat het bedrijf verwacht) en iemands persoonlijke behoeften (wat men verwacht van het werk) te integreren. In het algemeen, mensen de neiging om te kijken naar voornamelijk het geldelijk gewin wanneer zij op een baan, hoewel andere factoren doen komen in. Zeker, er zijn mensen die doen niet erg bezig met vuile werk, zolang ze hebben vrijheid om te werken buiten een kantoor of sommige andere extraatjes. Maar in de zakelijke wereld, lijken de opties beperkt dat vinden van kansen voor echte pret taai wordt. Toch is dit waar iemands creativiteit komt. En de Keeley Consulting Group heeft vele jaren ervaring in het omgaan met de nuances van het maken van mensen zien kansen voor groei en productiviteit terwijl niet offeren iemands noodzaak voor de lol op de werkplek. Dus, de Keeley Consulting Group , wordt een holistische onderneming zelf, houdt vast aan het idee dat bereiken evenwicht vereist integratie van alle gebieden in het leven die essentieel zijn voor iemands centrale beginselen, waaronder de volgende\: carrière, relaties, gezondheid, spirituele, financiële en welzijn. Dit zijn de ankers die verdienen van iemands leven stabiel en niet gemakkelijk verstoord wanneer obstakels of crises komen. De verwezenlijking van het evenwicht en harmonie in iemands leven en werk vereist kijken vier vraagstukken. Allereerst, wat zijn uw doelstellingen in het leven? Beantwoorden van deze vraag zet in focus de dingen die voor u belangrijk zijn. Instellen voordat u altijd de dingen waarmee u werken wilt voor maakt het werk minder omslachtig als u uw gezichten op de beloningen of de bestemming houden. Ten tweede, waar ben je nu? In welk stadium van uw carrière en uw relaties bent u in en hoe kunt u bewerkstelligen vruchtbare en positieve vooruitgang op beide gebieden? Wat is out-van-synch op elk gebied van uw leven zal bemoeilijken een probleem of belemmering kunnen optreden langs de weg. Dingen juiste instellen en verwijderen jezelf onproductieve situaties die u bent nu in krijgt u een betere kans op het verkrijgen van succes. Ten derde, wat kunt u nu doen? Wij allen streven naar geluk in wat wij zou kunnen doen. Velen streven naar tevredenheid in het verwerven van materiële dingen; echter, ze niet zien de waarde van de ontwikkeling van een meer geestelijk leven en het bereiken van een evenwichtige en positieve vooruitzichten in het leven. Verbetering van je innerlijke zelf kan brengen over een groter gevoel van betekenis en welzijn in het leven. Tot slot, wat doet u in de toekomst? Hebben geduld om dingen te zien door middel van is essentieel in wint verdere vooruitgang. Wij werken en leven in het heden; maar wat we doen zal invloed op de toekomst, of we dat nu leuk vinden of niet. Wachten om te zien hoe uw huidige inspanningen vruchten zal afwerpen is een deugd niet uitsluitend bedoeld voor boeren alleen. Als u de juiste voorbereiding van uw huidige beslissingen hebt gemaakt, hebt u het vertrouwen om te profiteren van de beloningen die u in de toekomst verdient. Vaker wel dan niet, zal een goed geplande en goed uitgevoerde programma recycle zelf zo lang als je leert om te passen langs de weg. Dit is hoe een sterke, winstgevende onderneming groeit en verdraagt. Het bereiken van een gezond, harmonieuze en evenwichtige leven is het primaire doel dat de Keeley Consulting Group Review wenst te geven aan haar leiderschap opleiding programmadeelnemers. Het pad naar leven kunnen een heldere en plezierige reis met de juiste mensen om u te begeleiden.

description561=Enhver, der har arbejdet i en bank eller et privat selskab, for sags skyld, ved, hvordan arbejdet kan tage på en stor vejafgift på ens liv og sundhed. En fem-dages-ugen, otte-timers-en-dag arbejde-og-nej-sjov-inden for kan næsten løbe ud liv juice, medmindre man har en stikkontakt for at afbalancere ligningen en eller anden måde. Men ville det ikke være dejligt, hvis arbejde allerede havde sjov inden for for at komme ud af slagmarken stadig smilende og ivrig efter at gøre en anden dag kampen den følgende dag? Dette kan synes for idealistiske eller fantasifulde for nogle; men en virksomhed, som Keeley Consulting Group , faktisk allerede gør det. All-business eller all-arbejde-og-nej-sjov appellerer ikke længere i den moderne forretningsverden, som det altid har haft tidligere. Business ledere vide hvad folk kigge efter i deres liv og deres job og give muligheder for folk til at udtrykke sig mere fuldt ud i deres arbejde tager intet mere end at give den balance, de har brug for og søger i andre områder af deres liv. Sjældne, selvom det kan synes for personer eller virksomheder i erhvervslivet til at tale om arbejde og sjov i ét åndedrag, det er et vigtigt princip, der har været forsømt i så lang tid. At opnå balance er en naturlig lov, som vi mennesker ikke kan bryde uden at forstyrre de væsentlige cyklusser, skabe orden og succes i vores liv og inden for vores samfund. Så, hvordan vi opnå denne balance? Ofte, er mennesker så fokuseret på nuværende uden hensyn til hvad der kunne ske i fremtiden. Arbejdsnarkomaner tendens til at tro, at arbejde er det primære, mens de glemmer, at arbejde er et middel mod et større mål; som giver muligheden for flertallet af mennesker til at nyde livet den måde, det skal nydes – ja, endda mens du arbejder, ikke bare når du er færdig med dit arbejde. Fabrikker, der laver legetøj bør være først til at udstille det sjove og spændingen ved at lave legetøj i stedet for at være de sweatshops, som mange måske forestille dem for at være. Forestil dig Santas elvere dovent og unsmilingly arbejder på at slå gamle Saint Nicks juleaften deadline, som om de var underbetalt, søvnløse slaver. Hvilken slags virkelige sjove ønsker at bringe til børnene og selv voksne i denne verden? Godt, at være jolly på arbejdspladsen kan spørge for meget af arbejdstagerne; men det kunne gøre en masse godt, hvis vi havde halvdelen af Julemandens sjovt på arbejde, især hvis det hjælper for at gøre arbejde værd at gøre, og som følge heraf mere effektiv. Uddannelse af mennesker at se på arbejdet og finde måder at opnå balance er netop en af de udfordringer, der er fremsat af Keeley Consulting Group til sin kursusdeltagere. I sidste ende, det er den person, der kan afgøre, hvordan at etablere denne balance i ens arbejdsliv. Det er et spørgsmål om at have den rette indstilling til at finde balancen mellem arbejde og sjov inden for de særlige omstændigheder i en bestemt virksomhedsmiljø. Man skal indse, at denne balance, vi søger ikke er et produkt af kultur eller af trial-and-error. Det skyldes at udvikle ens følsomhed over for de muligheder, der tillader en person at integrere kravene i ens arbejde (hvad selskabet forventer) og ens personlige behov (hvad man forventer af arbejdet). Generelt folk har tendens til at se primært på den monetære gevinst når de tager på et job, selv om andre faktorer kommer. Ganske vist, er der mennesker, der ikke har noget imod gør beskidte arbejde, så længe de har frihed til at arbejde uden for et kontor eller nogle andre frynsegoder. Men i erhvervslivet, indstillingerne kan synes begrænset at finde muligheder for reelle sjov bliver hård. Det er stadig, hvor ens kreativitet kommer. Og Keeley Consulting Group har mange års erfaring i håndtering af nuancerne i at gøre folk ser muligheder for vækst og produktivitet samtidig ikke ofrer sit behov for sjov på arbejdspladsen. Således Keeley Consulting Group , er en holistisk virksomhed, sig selv, overholder den idé, at opnå balance kræver integration af alle områder i livet, der er afgørende for ens centrale principper, som omfatter følgende\: karriere, relationer, sundhed, spirituelle, finansielle og velvære. Disse er de ankre, der gør livet stabilt og ikke let forstyrret når hindringer eller kriser kommer. At opnå balance og harmoni i ens liv og arbejde kræver ser på fire spørgsmål. Først og fremmest, hvad er dit mål i livet? Besvare dette spørgsmål sætter fokus de ting, der er vigtige for dig. Indstilling før du altid de ting, du ønsker at arbejde for gør arbejdet mindre belastende som du holder din seværdigheder på belønningerne eller destinationen. For det andet er hvor er du nu? I hvilken fase af din karriere og din relationer er du i og hvordan kan du bringe om frugtbare og positive fremskridt på begge områder? Hvad er ud-af-synkroniseret i ethvert område af dit liv vil komplicere ethvert problem eller hindring du kan støde på undervejs. Indstilling tingene rigtigt eller fjerne dig selv fra uproduktive situationer du befinder dig i nu vil give dig en bedre chance for at få succes. For det tredje, hvad kan du gøre nu? Vi alle stræber efter lykke jeg

description558="An International Study in Competency Education\: Postcards from Abroad" seeks to highlight components of competency education in international practice, to inform US policymakers and decision makers seeking to implement high-quality competency pathways at the state or local level. Other countries are studying our innovations, and we are studying theirs. This report first reviews the definition of competency-based learning. A brief lesson in the international vocabulary of competency education is followed by a review of global trends that complement our own efforts to improve performance and increase equitable outcomes. Next, we share an overview of competency education against a backdrop of global education trends (as seen in the international PISA exams), before embarking on an abbreviated world tour. We pause in Finland, British Columbia (Canada), New Zealand and Scotland, with interludes in Sweden, England, Singapore and Shanghai, all of which have embraced practices that can inform the further development of competency education in the United States.

description557=DesignShare/School Construction News (DS/SCN) Jurists have often critically reflected on their desire to know more about how teachers and students really experience so-called innovative award-winning schools. Through the DesignShare Post-Occupancy Evaluation Program, the intention is to give voice to the individuals whose lives are directly influenced by school design around the world. For the past four years, the DS/SCN Awards process has included an unique and unprecedented opportunity for submitters to offer the users of their school designs the chance to tell it like it is\: What works, and what does not about your school? This year marks the first year the assessment tool is available for use online during the submission process. Using the online survey tool Zoomerang.com, responses were gathered from seven projects out of the field of 63 projects submitted. Here, reactions to Victoria School (Singapore) and Cyber-Fair College (United States) are shared, and reasons for conducting a post-occupancy evaluation are discussed. A post-occupancy evaluation tool is included.

description556=The primary purpose of this exploratory study is to identify variations in the ways in which individual teachers in different educational contexts interpret their curriculum and plan their lessons and in particular to explore the possibility that cultural differences as identified by Hofstede (1991) may be a contributing factor to understanding how teachers understand their work. "Educational reform" has become a catchphrase in the Anglo-American world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and England and Wales, as well as in the Confucian Heritage Areas such as Mainland China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Across the world, the educational reform measures being implemented are surprisingly similar. This paper describes a study of how geography teachers in Queensland, Australia, Hong Kong, and Changchun, China, plan their lessons and curriculum. From classroom observations and interviews with the teachers involved, we confirmed marked differences in each location regarding their cultural traits of power distance, individualist and collectivist preference and uncertainty tolerance, and that these traits appear to be highly influential in their curriculum planning. Despite the small scale of this study, we contend that there are good reasons for caution before national education systems import policies and curriculum reform initiatives from other countries for unthinking adoption. (Contains 1 table and 7 notes.) [An Appendix containing a summary of points in the textbook, suggested teaching method in teachers' reference and points that Mr. Au, a junior secondary geography teacher in Changchun, covered in his lessons on railways in China, is appended to this document.]

description555=Lifelong learning through a strong, policy-supported information technology (IT) infrastructure is critical to the success of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member economies. There is a great need to upgrade the quality of skills within the workforce, and there have been unprecedented investments in infrastructure and advanced technology. Quality, productivity, and innovation are required in a competitive environment, and can be established through lifelong learning. Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and Malaysia have all developed new approaches to workforce learning, either through increased technical training in conjunction with industry, or through the establishment of multimedia educational facilities. Canada is developing an infrastructure that will facilitate long term access to learning opportunities. Initiatives include\: (1) The Information Highway Advisory Council, which creates jobs and universal access to the Internet; (2) The Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, Industry and Education, which facilitates communications structure; (3) SchoolNet, which enhances educational opportunities; and (4) Health Iway, which provides health services across the country. Those who may be negatively affected by the initiative are rural workers, women, minorities, and blue collar workers if it reinforces existing workforce inequalities. However, through the use of partnership, technology, infrastructure development, and operative programming, the common goal of a lifelong education may be met. (YKH)

description552=Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) of 1000A GaNAs films grown on (100) oriented GaAs substrate by radio frequency (RF) plasma assisted solid-source molecular beam epitaxy was studied by low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) and high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD). Samples with nitrogen content of 1.3 and 2.2% have shown an overall blueshift in energy of 67.7 meV and an intermediate redshift of 42.2 meV in the PL spectra when subjected to RTA at 529-850 deg C for 10 min. It is also shown that the sample which is annealed at temperature range of 700-750 deg C, has the highest photoluminescence efficiency (1.7-2.1 times increase in integrated PL intensity as compared to the as-grown sample). Reciprocal space mapping of the as-grown GaNAs samples obtained by using triple-crystal HRXRD shows the presence of interstitially incorporated of N atoms with no lattice relaxation in the direction parallel to the growth surface. These results have significant implication on the growth and post-growth treatment of nitride compound semiconductor materials for high performance optoelectronics devices.

description550=The curriculum landscape in Singapore has been undergoing significant changes recently. While there exists a national curriculum and a central curriculum agency, the Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD) within the Ministry of Education (MoE), there is a movement toward what is termed "school-based curriculum development." This movement can be seen as a consequence of the implementation of numerous educational initiatives progressively launched since the mid-1990s. Such a movement creates new challenges for schools and teachers, and has far-reaching implications for curriculum development, instructional effectiveness, and teachers' professional development. This article explores the meanings, challenges, and implications of school-based curriculum development (SBCD) within the context of current educational initiatives in Singapore.

description549=The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of group work as a strategy for attribution retraining and improving students' motivational styles. Students were first categorised into one of three motivational styles\: learned helplessness, self-worth motivation and mastery orientation. In the intervention procedure, selected students from each of these three categories were subjected to an intervention procedure requiring the students to work in groups, with the emphasis on personal effort as the major contributor to group success. Post-intervention assessment of motivation showed an improvement in the motivation of self-worth motivated students although there was generally a decrease in mastery orientation amongst students in both the control as well as the experimental groups.

description546=The World Trade Organisation (WTO) the successor to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) came into existence in January 1995 after the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Since its establishment, series of Ministerial meetings starting with Singapore (1996), Geneva (1998), Seattle (1999) and Doha (2001) have been instrumental in setting the broad agenda for the process of permanent negotiations. These negotiations sets up legally enforceable commercial rules for international trade in Goods, Agriculture, Intellectual Property and Services like health, water and education. The fifth Ministerial meeting of WTO held in Mexican tourist destination of Cancun was the second such meeting ,after Seattle, to dramatically collapse and present the deep institutional crisis. The dossier helps a deeper and more informed civil society engagement on issues for trade negotiations and their implications on democracy , peoples participation in Development and the accountability of governments to its people. It highlights also the rise of global civil society solidarity and campaign against unilateral and neo-colonial positions of developed countries in the North.

description540=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 8 . Abstract Growing evidence demonstrates that various large DNA viruses could encode microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate host and viral genes to achieve immune evasion. In this study, we report that miR-homoHSV, an miRNA encoded by Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), can attenuate SGIV-induced cell death. Mechanistically, SGIV miR-homoHSV targets SGIV ORF136R, a viral gene that encodes the pro-apoptotic lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α (LITAF)-like factor. miR-homoHSV suppressed exogenous and endogenous SGIV LITAF expression, and thus inhibited SGIV LITAF-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-homoHSV expression was able to attenuate cell death induced by viral infection, presumably facilitating viral replication through the down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene SGIV LITAF. Together, our data suggest miR-homoHSV may serve as a feedback regulator of cell death during viral infection. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of SGIV replication and pathogenesis.

description538=Many have become aware of the need to assess both teachers' and students' perceptions of the learning environment. This study involved 1,592 tenth grade students and their teachers (n\=56) in a study that investigated four aims\: (1) to cross validate a slightly modified version of the actual and preferred versions of the Science Laboratory Environment Inventory (SLEI) for assessing teachers' and students' perception of the learning environment in chemistry laboratory classes in the Singapore secondary school; (2) investigate the differences in perception of the actual and preferred chemistry laboratory environments between teachers and students, students of different streams, and male and female students; (3) examine associations between students' attitudes towards chemistry and their perceived laboratory environments; and (4) compare the science laboratory environments in Singapore with those of Australia, the United States, Canada, England, Israel, and Nigeria. The results revealed that\: (1) perceptions of students and teachers differed; (2) preferred perceptions were generally more favorable than actual perceptions; (3) students from different streams differed only in their preferred perceptions; and (4) females held more favorable perceptions than males.

description534=Issues surrounding the testing and evaluation of speaking in Singapore secondary schools are examined, including the questions of what skills and knowledge a speech evaluator should possess and what model of spoken knowledge--Received Pronunciation (RP) or Singapore English--should be provided. Oral tests, developed for the English language section of the Functional Objectives of Language Learning (FOLL) project by the Institute of Education in Singapore to determine the extent to which students achieve the functional objectives of syllabuses, are also surveyed. Finally, an evaluation study of the opinions and attitudes of some Singapore teachers and pupils towards the teaching and learning of spoken English is briefly summarized. It is concluded that the evaluation of speaking in secondary schools is clearly linked with the evaluation and valuing of spoken language by all teachers and by the school system itself. Techniques for evaluating speaking skills are developing, but there is a great need for administrators to acknowledge the complexity and importance of these skills both for teachers and for pupils.

description533=The purpose of the study was to examine four questions concerning English Language Learners (ELLs). First, does English Language Learner status impact math scores? Second, does immigrant status favorably contribute to math achievement? Third, what math achievement is possible in other countries where there is multilingualism or high immigrant populations? Fourth, and most specifically, how can international exams help us address the issue of Latin American ELLs in Texas, who make up almost 15 percent of students? This article used data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) of 2008, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of 2006, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) of 2003, and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) to examine mathematics achievement of English Language Learners in Texas based on country of origin. The international comparisons implied three conclusions\: economic inequity hurts math achievement, class size should decrease, and teacher pay should increase. However, these factors held true to some degree for all U.S. students as well. Three possibilities to explain the data were further examined\: poverty, ethnicity, and language. It was found that a more significant barrier to math success than poverty, ethnicity, or language was the interaction of ethnicity and language ability. Other countries which have immigrant populations, such as Canada and Singapore, have avoided achievement gaps, which indicates that math success with immigrants is possible. Strategies suggested to address these gaps in learning in the U.S. include differentiated instruction, additional instruction time, support for each student, and high expectations.
description532=This paper presents journal entries from students at Singapore's National Institute of Education (NIE) during their first practice teaching experience at local elementary schools. The paper suggests that one of the best ways to help preservice teachers come to terms with their school experience is to encourage daily journal writing throughout the first-year practicum. The students' journal entries focus on the roles of cooperating teachers and their student teachers, classroom management, and gaps between NIE coursework and school practice. The journal entries provide a sense of how student teachers see their own roles and those of the teachers with whom they work. They also reveal student teachers' concerns about developing appropriate methods of classroom management and applying what they have learned at the NIE to real Singaporean classrooms. (SM)
description531=This study investigated associations between teacher-student interaction and students' attitudes towards chemistry among 497 tenth grade students from three independent schools in Singapore. Analyses supported the reliability and validity of a 48-item version of the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI). Statistically significant gender differences and stream differences (i.e. gifted vs. non-gifted) were observed for numerous QTI scales, but gender x stream interactions also emerged. Associations were found between the interpersonal behavior of chemistry teachers and students' enjoyment of their chemistry lessons.
description530=This study investigates the effects of teacher written feedback on students' writing in the Singapore primary school context. We discuss different types of teacher feedback--advice, criticism, and praise--and how successful each is in encouraging revisions by Primary 4 children. Quality of revision is discussed in terms of length and overall improvement in the revised compositions. Student attitudes are also explored through a questionnaire. The questionnaire responses provide some insight into why some types of teacher feedback encouraged more revision than others. (Contains 1 footnote, 8 tables and 1 figure.)

description526=Dr. Taufik Abdullah, ahli sejarah ternama, sering bergurau bahwa ada History (sejarah) dan ada lebih banyak lagi His Story (ceritanya). Kami ingin meneruskan gurauan ini dengan berkata bahwa ada Sejarah dan ada sejarah. Yakni ada Sejarah Utama yang mengkisahkan pergolakan dan gerakan fokal dari sesuatu masyarakat tetapi ada juga sejarah sampingan yang seakan terpendam dan memang tidak begitu penting pada umumnya namun, pada tempatnya sendiri, memainkan peranan besar dan mempunyai dampak mendalam pada para pelaku dan sekitarnya. Dr. Stevens menguraikan sejarah suatu tarekat yang khusus terdiri dari pria, yang berkedudukan mapan, pada jaman Hindia Belanda dan beberapa tahun sesudah kemerdekaan. Pada awalnya pergerakan ini hanya beranggotakan pria Eropa, terutama Belanda, dan di kemudian harinya mulailah orang Indonesia masuk-kebanyakannya dari kaum ningrat. Menjelang akhir sejarahnya, tarekat ini menjadi suatu tarekat Indonesia. Pergerakan ini kemudian dibubarkan oleh Soekarno dan kemudian tidak pernah timbul lagi di Indonesia-padahal organisasi yang dibubarkan bersamaan seperti the Rotary Club telah bangkit kembali. Hal ini tidaklah menjadi soal bagi penerbitan buku ini karena Pustaka Sinar Harapan terutama tertarik pada aspek sosial-historis dari tarekat ini di Indonesia. Ada tiga hal yang menarik dari sejarah organisasi ini. Yang pertama ialah tarekat ini tidak pernah berakar di bumi Indonesia padahal banyak pemimpin Indonesia sebelum Perang Dunia II menjadi anggota malah memegang posisi pimpinan dan banyak pula kaitannya dengan gerakan kemerdekaan dini. Yang kedua ialah bahwa walaupun banyak anggotanya memegang jabatan kunci baik di pihak Belanda maupun di pihak Indonesia, pada umurnnya para anggota tarekat ini tidak dapat berpengaruh di kubunya masing masing apalagi berperan dalam konflik Indonesia- Belanda. Yang ketiga ialah melalui banyak pekerjaan pelayanan masyarakat terutama melalui sekolah sekolahnya yang bermutu tinggi telah terbentuk-mungkin juga dengan tidak sengaja-kawula muda yang nantinya menjadi sebagian dari elite Indonesia modern. Buku ini merupakan langkah pertama dari Penerbit Pustaka Sinar Harapan untuk memajukan sejarah sampingan Indonesia. Dalam seri ini yang terutama akan ditampilkan ialah karya-karya mengenai jaman kolonial modernÃ¢katakanlah antara tahun1860 sampai normalisasi hubungan setelah Irian Jaya. Penulis yang ditonjolkan bukan saja terdiri dari penulis Belanda, yang digolongkan sebagai penulis Belanda ialah semuanya yang memakai bahasa Belanda, dan penulis lndonesia tetapi juga penulis lainnya di luar ke dua golongan ini. Dalam konteks ini Pustaka Sinar Harapan berharap menerbitkan buku-buku mcngenai sejarah sesuatu daerah ataupun sejarah; dari organisasi masyarakat; keluarga; biografi, sejarah dan budaya pcrkapalan, dari perusahaan perkebunan serta keluarga-keluarga yang menjalankannya; kemiliteran; kepolisian; pamong praja- Binnenlands Bestuur; kepanduan; golongan Tionghoa; pendidikan; budaya campuran; dan sebagainya; baik yang ditulis dengan kacamata Belanda maupun sudut pandang lainnya. Mungkin karya-karya seperti ini dapat memperkaya khasanah kita dan membantu kita untuk lebih mengerti keseluruhan sejarah kita. Toenggoel P.

description524=The introduction and implementation of computer-based learning (CBL) in primary schools in Singapore has created both benefits and problems. This study examined the attitudes and level of anxiety of 77 students toward CBL through two scales, the Computer Programming Anxiety Scale and the Liking for Computer-Related Activities Scale. Results showed a high level of confidence and feelings of adequacy when working with CBL. Only 5 out of 77 students did not feel confident working on computers, and very few indicated worry about performing on the computer in front of peers or the teacher. The students also had a strong liking for computer-related activities\: over one-third of the students expressed a strong liking for learning to use programming software and to install a computer, and about half liked to maintain and repair computers and learn how computers are assembled. These attitudes contrast sharply with those of junior college students, who were investigated in an earlier study. (EV)
description523=A study of the relationship between student perceptions and learning behaviors attempted to answer the questions\: (1) What are the perceptions of academic responsibility of the students? (2) How different are their perceptions when school, class, level of performance, and gender are different? and (3) To what extent is their perception of responsibility related to their learning outcome? Subjects, 291 male and female adolescent students from five schools in Singapore, completed the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility (IAR) Scale. Results indicated that the students have a sense of responsibility and are more likely to accept blame for failure than personal credit for success. This response is stronger among high achievers and top classes than for lower achievers and classes, and also stronger among girls than boys. No correlation was found between students' responses to successful or positive events and performance, but there was a high correlation between their responses to negative events and performance. This outcome suggests that those who accept greater blame for failure are motivated to work harder to achieve. Contains 10 references. (DMG)

description517=Last month was the hottest on record for some areas of southeast Texas. The city of Galveston beat out a high set more than 100 years ago after the mercury climbed to an average of 70.5 degrees this March. Before that, the record was in 1907, when the thermometer averaged 70.4 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. College Station saw record-breaking heat as well, narrowly edging past a high set in 2012. This March beat it by one-tenth of a degree at 67.2 degrees. "For this particular month, the warmer-than-normal overnight lows contributed to the higher temperatures," NWS meteorologist Charles Roeseler said. "More cloud cover at night kept temperatures warmer." But in the Houston area, March was hot - but not record-breaking.  The highest average temperature for the month was set back in 1907 when the mercury rose to 71.8 degrees on an average day. This year was a little cooler, at 68.2 degrees, making it the eighth-hottest March on record.  Year-to-date temps have been record-breaking across the region. In Houston, Galveston and College Station , average 2017 temperatures have clocked in at 64.8 degrees, 66.9 degrees and 62.8 degrees, respectively.

description516=This report presents the results of pragmatically selected tryouts of the English Language Services "Teacher Education Program" in the Regional English Language Centre in Singapore, the Central Institute of English in Hyderabad, and the Instituto Pedagogico in Caracas. American Institutes for Research, in submitting the present evaluation to the Agency for International Development, under whose aegis TEP was developed, presents criticisms and recommendations concerning various aspects of the materials and equipment involved. Findings of the feasibility check indicated that (1) it was feasible to administer the TEP course as a teacher education program (2) the course could be administered smoothly, and (3) the optimum application of the system in these three countries had not been reached. It was concluded that TEP is a "workable alternative which warrants serious consideration for a variety of purposes." Appended to this report are an outline description of TEP, a sample progress check , a teacher training costs summary, and a listing of project personnel. For further information on this self-instructional course in training teachers of English as a second language, see ED 036 795. (AMM)

Indkomst betragtninger • føjes til en eksisterende virksomhed med succes kan føre dig direkte til højere indkomstskat, så overvej om det nye joint venture skal være en del af den eksisterende virksomhed eller separat. • Selskaber betaler skat til lavere priser end enkeltpersoner og potentielt giver mere fleksibilitet, når overskuddet er der. De kan også beskytte den eksisterende forretning mod risikoen fra business fiasko, hvis det går galt. • Er alle familiemedlemmer med deres grundlæggende sats banderolerne - hvis ikke, kan de inddrages i det nye selskab? • Nogle former for virksomheder vil være tabsgivende tidligt i år - dette kan være en ulempe for den nye forretning er ikke en del af den eksisterende forretning, som tab kan det være nødvendigt at finde frem til nye venture forvandler en fortjeneste. Hvis det er en del af en eksisterende virksomhed, er det sandsynligt, at tabene i et område kan modregnes i indkomst fra et andet. Moms • er en indtægtskilde momsfritagelse? Hvis ja, kan det have en indvirkning på moms opsving og hvad er kendt som den delvise fritagelse beregningen for den primære virksomhed. Kort sagt, det kan betyde mindre moms er regenereret end ellers. • Hvis den nye virksomhed er en afgiftspligtig levering - for eksempel afgifter moms på det forsyner - det gør den konkurrencedygtig? F. eks. B&B indkomst er levering af indkvartering og forplejning og hvis aggregerede med en main (momsregistreret) virksomhed, vil det være nødt til at opkræve 20% moms. Forskellige virksomhedsejere til virksomheden kan hjælpe, men pas på HMRC "opdeling" regler, der skal forhindre kunstige opdeling af virksomheder. Kapital og finansiering • Helt nye ventures kræver driftskapital. Hvordan vil det være forudsat - enten interne familie lån, eller ekstern finansiering via bank eller anden kilde - og hvad kan det gøre for resten af virksomheden? • En separat bankkonto m ay blive behov for nye forretninger, hvis med en anden ejer. Det er under alle omstændigheder altid god husholdning til at holde transaktioner separat og transparent, ikke kun fordi det kan være et krav, men også for at det nye joint venture og dets bidrag kan en omkostningsvurdering og overvåges. Aktivering af næste generation • er dette et projekt for at få næste generation driver? Det kan give stor erfaring og selvstændighed, igen at gøre brug af basissatsen bands. • Adskillelse mellem virksomheder kan også være nyttig for generationsskifteplanlægning, især hvor den næste generation har forskellige interesser eller karriere retninger.
description511=Trans-boundary biomass burning smoke episodes have increased dramatically during the past 20-30 years and have become an annual phenomenon in the South-East-Asia region. On 15th October 2010, elevated levels of fire activity were detected by remote sensing satellites (e.g. MODIS). On the same date, measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at Singapore and Malaysia found high levels of fine mode particles in the local environment. All these observations were indicative of the initial onset of a smoke episode that lasted for several days. In this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of this smoke episode by analyzing the physical and optical properties of smoke particles with the aid of an AERONET Sun photometer, an MPLNet micropulse lidar, and surface PM2.5 measurements. Elevated levels of fire activity coupled with high aerosol optical depth and PM2.5 were observed over a period of nine days. Increased variability of parameters such as aerosol optical depth, Angstrom exponent number and its fine mode equivalents all indicated high levels of fine particulate presence in the atmosphere. Smoke particle growth due to aging, coagulation and condensation mechanisms was detected during the afternoons and over several days. Retrieved lidar ratios were compatible with the presence of fine particulate within the boundary/aerosol layer. Moreover, retrieved particle size distribution as well as single scattering albedo indicated the prevalence of the fine mode particulate regime as well as particles showing enhanced levels of absorption respectively.

description497=The Keeley Consulting Group onlangs uitgevoerde bepaalde beoordelingen over beleidsontwikkeling. Het blijkt dat een organisatie nodig heeft om te bouwen van een duidelijk omschreven en zorgvuldig geschreven beleid met het oog op een gezellig, bemoedigend, georganiseerde, veilige en onbevooroordeelde werkplek. In feite, veel van ons niet graag een inconsistente en inconsistent toegepast beleid. Zij resulteren vaak in meer problemen op de top van degene die ze waren bedoeld om op te lossen. Echter zijn beleid een essentieel onderdeel van elke organisatie. Ze definiëren de nodige richtsnoeren voor bedrijven functioneert en invloed uitoefenen op het gedrag van particulieren om een specifieke uitkomst. Kunt u overwegen de volgende tips gegeven door The Keeley Consulting Group over het nieuwe beleid voor uw organisatie te ontwikkelen. Ten eerste, ervoor zorgen dat er een beleid over het beleid is. We weten dat het klinkt een beetje overbodig, maar het is nodig om te werken in een vooraf gedefinieerde en besloten kader, zelfs als het gaat om beleidsvorming. Waarschijnlijk is de eerste en belangrijkste stap in het rijpen beleid om een eenvoudige beleid op beleid dat van de organisatie proces verduidelijkt voor het maken van nieuw beleid te maken. Dit beleid moet bestaan uit advies over wat situaties de noodzaak voor een nieuw beleid, het formaat dat nieuwe beleid moeten gebruiken, evenals het proces dat gevolgd worden voor een nieuw beleid vormen moet moet worden goedgekeurd. Er is een hoge kans dat u hebben zult een grote inconsistentie in de resultaten en inconsistentie in de oprichting als u niet een proces en een kader rond beleidsvorming hoeft. Dit kan ook resulteren in slechte of moeilijke handhaving. Ten tweede, identificeren overlappingen met bestaande beleid. U moet grondig controleren als het beleid dat u van plan bent om te maken al bestaat of het delen van het bestaat in het overige beleid voordat u een nieuw beleid maakt. Als dat het geval is, kunt u overwegen herziening van bestaande beleidsmaatregelen in plaats van een nieuwe thuisgroep te maken. Ten derde, maak het beleid niet in een vacuüm. The Keeley Consulting Group suggereert dat beleid moeten worden ontwikkeld met input uit die zal worden beïnvloed door hen eerder dan zitten achter uw bureau en een make-beleid dat u voelde nodig waren en die werden ontwikkeld geheel op uw eigen. Het is belangrijk dat alle belanghebbenden worden gehoord om de mogelijkheid voor de gevolgen van het ongeluk, alhoewel het definitieve beleid uiteindelijk niet met alle adviezen overeen kan. Beleid moeten zeker zijn afgerond en toegevoegde adviezen kunnen helpen eventuele leemten die zich kunnen voordoen. Ten vierde, een stap terug en nadenken over de noodzaak. Houd er rekening mee dat u beleidsregels maken moet wanneer er een duidelijke noodzaak en een duidelijk probleem op te lossen, niet alleen omdat iemand deed iets u niet graag. Volgens de beoordeling Keeley Consulting Group, sommige polissen werden ingevoerd uit ondanks en als wraak, en dit soort activiteit zou niet gebeuren in een verstandige organisatie. Het zal niet ook gebeuren in een bedrijf dat een strikt beleid op beleid heeft, zoals het beleid vaak door meerdere niveaus voor goedkeuring gaat.   Ten vijfde, maken gebruik van de juiste woorden, dus er geen misverstanden bestaan zullen. Zorg ervoor dat u eenvoudig en specifieke terminologie gebruikt omdat beleid gemakkelijk te begrijpen moeten om effectief te zijn. We hieronder vindt u enkele belangrijke tips\: -Gebruik de woorden “moeten” of “will” in plaats van moet”” in de hoofdtekst van het beleid. Als er iets is optioneel, gebruik het woord “moet” maar niet wanneer het is een vereiste. -Gebruik een afdeling, kantoor, eenheid, of functie in plaats van iemands naam. -Contact e-mails moeten met een algemene afdeling adres of een webpagina waarmee aanvullende contactgegevens. Kunt u voorkomen dat een iemands e-mail adres gebruiken om te voorkomen dat het beleid van updates nodig wanneer personele veranderingen gebeuren. -Niet onderstrepen subkoppen of woorden die moeten worden benadrukt in een zin. In plaats daarvan stel onderverdelingen in vet of cursief als een woord moet worden benadrukt. Als het beleid is gepost online, zou kunnen onderstreepte woorden worden verward met hyperlinks. Ten zesde, omvatten een proces uitzonderingen mogelijk. In de meeste gevallen is er een uitzondering voor elke regel. Het is veel gemakkelijker om te bepalen hoe een proces van uitzonderingen is te bedienen van tevoren voordat het beleid wordt geïmplementeerd. Wees u ervan bewust dat uitzonderingen moeten worden toegekend in een rechtvaardige en redelijke wijze. Het hele beleid kan vraagtekens worden geplaatst als u slordig met de uitzonderingen-proces. Zevende, kunnen sommige grijstinten. The Keeley Consulting Group is van mening dat sommige polissen moeten vertrekken een beetje dubbelzinnigheid voor mensen om te besluiten maken. Het is oke als uw beleid een beetje grijs laat zodat een individu kan een on-the-fly beslissing maken. Achtste, definiëren beleid onderhoud verantwoordelijkheid. Meeste beleid vereist regelmatig om ervoor te zorgen hun voortdurende toepasbaarheid. Zorg ervoor dat u altijd het Bureau dat verantwoordelijk is voor het beleid omdat iemand nodig heeft om ter verduidelijking informatie verstrekken wanneer vragen zijn gesteld over het beleid te kunnen herkennen. Individuen niet identificeren aangezien ze komen en gaan. Tot slot, instellen van een beleid bibliotheek met versiebeheer. Tegenwoordig, zijn er verscheidene hulpmiddelen die u toelaten om het opslaan van verschillende versies van documenten. Alle werknemers moeten zitten kundig voor toegang tot alle passende beleidsmaatregelen de allertijden. Versiebeheer kan ook helpen individuen om de geschiedenis van het beleid om bij te houden wat veranderd door de jaren heen te zien.

description489=A daily battle for rights and freedoms in cyberspace is being waged in Asia. At the epicenter of this contest is China--home to the world’s largest Internet population and what is perhaps the world’s most advanced Internet censorship and surveillance regime in cyberspace. Resistance to China’s Internet controls comes from both grassroots activists and corporate giants such as Google. Meanwhile, similar struggles play out across the rest of the region, from India and Singapore to Thailand and Burma, although each national dynamic is unique. Access Contested, the third volume from the OpenNet Initiative (a collaborative partnership of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, and the SecDev Group in Ottawa), examines the interplay of national security, social and ethnic identity, and resistance in Asian cyberspace, offering in-depth accounts of national struggles against Internet controls as well as updated country reports by ONI researchers. The contributors examine such topics as Internet censorship in Thailand, the Malaysian blogosphere, surveillance and censorship around gender and sexuality in Malaysia, Internet governance in China, corporate social responsibility and freedom of expression in South Korea and India, cyber attacks on independent Burmese media, and distributed-denial-of-service attacks and other digital control measures across Asia.

description487=Are you planning to start the business of your dreams? Alfa One Corporation Accounting Solutions can make it happen. If you have personal savings, you can use it to finance your needs to get started, which may include computers, brainstorming sessions, and the user experience designer. However, some individuals achieve a lot of things for their small business, but fails at one thing\: accounting, simply because they only put their receipts on one of their desk drawers every day or two to keep track of all their expenses. When they opt to open a business bank account, they’ve been shuffling between different credit and debit cards to pay employees and sellers, and they had late fees and interest piling up. And thus, they’ll end up calling accounting majors for help. If you can’t identify which receipts are personal or business-related, your financial history and profit-and-loss reports will be inaccurate. It’ll be a real struggle for you if you don’t have a proper accounting system set up for your small business. It’s also a poor habit to combine business and personal finances. You can easily consult Alfa One Corporation Accounting Solutions now in Tokyo, Japan for an even more expert advice. For now, here are few accounting tips for your small business\: Identify the costs Create a summary of all the costs you’ll need to take into account as soon as you make an idea about your small business. Make sure that you remember the costs including the preparation of a business plan or renting an office space. This can help you determine your business expenses and stop you from mistaking personal expenses for business expenses in the future. Quickly set up business accounts  As an entrepreneur, you should open a separate business checking and savings account when you start your business. This allows you to keep your small business accounts separate, simple and direct. Use the right card You don’t need a sharp memory for this one, and remember that there should be no excuses. It’ll be surely hard for you if you accidentally use your business credit or debit card for personal expenses. You can also put a mark on each card if you have trouble remembering which card to use, or open the cards at different banks. Transfer your income to your personal account Some small business owners make personal purchases on their business cards as their income. It’s sometimes easy to think that way, but it’s not the case. It’s wrong to make this a habit. Keep in mind that you should make the transfer for the amount you need from your business account to your personal account when you need to take an owner’s draw. Be as paperless as possible Putting the receipts on shoeboxes? This case is quite common in small business accounting. However, this era is coming to an end. Look around you, most data can be stored online, right? So this is not surprising. As a new entrepreneur, you should consider the benefits of running a paperless office. Alfa One Corporation Accounting Solutions can play an important role with this one since they’re great in handling most accounting concerns. Choose electronic payments and online invoicing Electronic payments and online invoicing should be an integral part of your small business accounting, especially here in Tokyo, Japan. Business owners can have the advantage of saving time and having less stress of not having to remember to pay the bills because of automatic debit. It’s such a good thing that bill payments were made easy today. You should better think twice and choose online invoicing and offer electronic payment because you don’t want to be one of those business owners who are still sending their clients paper invoices and waiting for a long time to get paid. If you want to make your books much simpler, you have to completely remove paper check writing. Great advisors should be in your team It’s totally fine if you have a lot of questions about your small business accounting. As a new entrepreneur, you can ask for the help of experts from Singapore, Malaysia, or Hong Kong such as the Alfa One Corporation Accounting Solutions. A positive change is expected if you have an access to a team of financial experts, especially when you’re starting a business. Establish a relationship with accounting professionals as soon as possible, and you’ll benefit not only with their advice but also with their networks over time.

description485=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 8 . Abstract HIV-1 subtype B and CRF01_AE are the predominant infecting subtypes among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Singapore. The genetic history, population dynamics and pattern of transmission networks of these genotypes remain largely unknown. We delineated the phylodynamic profiles of HIV-1 subtype B, CRF01_AE and the recently characterized CRF51_01B strains circulating among the MSM population in Singapore. A total of 105 (49.5%) newly-diagnosed treatment-naïve MSM were recruited between February 2008 and August 2009. Phylogenetic reconstructions of the protease gene (HXB2\: 2239 – 2629), gp120 (HXB2\: 6942 – 7577) and gp41 (HXB2\: 7803 – 8276) of the env gene uncovered five monophyletic transmission networks (two each within subtype B and CRF01_AE and one within CRF51_01B lineages) of different sizes (involving 3 – 23 MSM subjects, supported by posterior probability measure of 1.0). Bayesian coalescent analysis estimated that the emergence and dissemination of multiple sub-epidemic networks occurred between 1995 and 2005, driven largely by subtype B and later followed by CRF01_AE. Exponential increase in effective population size for both subtype B and CRF01_AE occurred between 2002 to 2007 and 2005 to 2007, respectively. Genealogical estimates suggested that the novel CRF51_01B lineages were probably generated through series of recombination events involving CRF01_AE and multiple subtype B ancestors. Our study provides the first insight on the phylodynamic profiles of HIV-1 subtype B, CRF01_AE and CRF51_01B viral strains circulating among MSM in Singapore.

description481=Thesis--University of Toronto volume 1 found here\: British naval strategy in the Far East, 1919-1942 \: a study of priorities in the question of imperial defense The foundation of the British Empire was predicated on a basic unwritten contract between the Pacific Dominions, Britain’s Far Eastern Empire and that of the United Kingdom\: when threatened the Dominions would come to the aid of the mother country. The converse is that if the Dominions were imperiled, the United Kingdom would sacrifice all other strategic priorities (with the exception of the defence of the UK itself) and rush to their aid. But at the end of the First World War, the British, once master of every sea they surveyed, now found themselves facing an isolationist United States, an aggressive Japan and a series of minor conflicts within the Empire. My thesis analyses the events that led up to Singapore becoming a major naval base. It examines why the strategy based on Singapore failed. It looks at the major factors involved, such as the role of the U.S. in strategic planning over the period 1919-1942. This was so particularly with the end of the Anglo-Japanese alliance of 1902. The sidebar issues include the underestimation of the Japanese capability, much of which was founded on basic racism. But the essential issue was paying for and manning a two-ocean navy. Defending two-oceans with a one-ocean navy was clearly impossible, unless the British could find an ally, most logically, the U.S., which was, at the time, singularly uninterested. That said, my thesis examines the evolution of British strategy for defending her Pacific and Far Eastern Empire. The lynch pin of that strategy was the development of the huge Singapore Naval Base whose strategic location would prevent a Japanese attack into the Indian Ocean or south to the Dominions. It soon became known as the Gibraltar of the Far East, impregnable, standing guard over one of the world’s most important waterways. I argue that it was a strategy fraught with contradictions, changing priorities, dubious conclusions and illusions, and a consistent liberality with the truth when it came to promises to defend Australia and New Zealand. Much of this was exposed when Japanese soldiers, in a savage 70-day campaign stormed down the Malay peninsula. On February 15, 1942 the Japanese accepted the surrender of Singapore . It was the greatest military disaster in modern British history. Over 100,000 British, Dominion and Imperial soldiers were now about to endure the brutality of Japanese POW camps where thousands died.\nVita\nBibliography\: leaves 485-536\n34 52\nNEW\n

description479=This article is from Chinese Journal of Cancer , volume 30 . Abstract The unusual incidence patterns for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in China, Northeast India, Arctic Inuit, Peninsular and island Southeast Asia, Polynesian Islanders, and North Africans indicate a role for NPC risk genes in Chinese, Chinese-related, and not-obviously Chinese-related populations. Renewed interest in NPC genetic risk has been stimulated by a hypothesis that NPC population patterns originated in Bai-Yue / pre-Austronesian–speaking aborigines and were dispersed during the last glacial maximum by Sundaland submersion. Five articles in this issue of the Chinese Journal of Cancer, first presented at a meeting on genetic aspects of NPC [National Cancer Center of Singapore (NCCS), February 20–21, 2010], are directed towards incidence patterns, to early detection of affected individuals within risk populations, and to the application of genetic technology advances to understanding the nature of high risk. Turnbull presents a general framework for understanding population migrations that underlie NPC and similar complex diseases, including other viral cancers. Trejaut et al. apply genetic markers to detail migration from East Asia through Taiwan to the populating of Island Polynesia. Migration dispersal in a westward direction took mongoloid peoples to modern day Northeast India adjacent to Western China (Xinjiang). NPC incidence in mongoloid Nagas ranks amongst the highest in the world, whereas elsewhere in India NPC is uncommon. Cao et al. detail incidence patterns in Southeast China that have occurred over recent decades. Finally, Ji et al. describe the utility of Epstein-Barr virus serostatus in early NPC detection. While genetic risk factors still remain largely unknown, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been a focus of attention since the discovery of an HLA association with NPC in 1973 and, two years later, that NPC susceptibility in highest-risk Cantonese involved the co-occurrence of multi-HLA locus combinations of HLA genes as chromosome combinations, or haplotypes (e.g. HLA-A2–B46), whereas in relatively lower-risk non-Cantonese Chinese (Hokkiens, Teochews) they appeared to act independently, a strength of association reflecting the 30–50-fold difference in incidence between highest risk Cantonese and lowest-risk Indians. The prototypic haplotype HLA-A2–B46 extends over megabases. An upstream DNA segment (near HLA-DPA1), has close similarity to Gorilla, with no obvious homology to Chimpanzee in current databases, suggesting that a reticulate model of primate evolution may be more appropriate than simple phylogeny. The DNA variation level in this segment is high enough for it to be a hominin remnant. HLA-B46 arose in mongoloids and remains largely limited to Chinese so the question arises as to whether the hominin candidate segment indicates an eastward trek of Homo neanderthalensis or the survival of much earlier Homo erectus? In 2011 sequencing technologies have finally caught up with the requirement to separate parental haplotypes. Recently achieved chromosome separation for whole genome di-haploid genetic and epigenetic analysis of parental inheritance in single individuals will reveal interacting patterns of multi-locus haplotypes as humans move in and through successive environments, thus providing definitive information on the genetic affinities between extant populations, and of the migrations that have led to the global distribution of modern Homo. The challenge can now be met of seeking HLA-associated locations both within and outside the HLA complex on each of the pair of chromosomes. More broadly, for every disease, genetic risk detection will require resolution of the diploid genome as a di-haplome.

description474=This article is from Archives of Plastic Surgery , volume 41 . Abstract Microsurgery training in Singapore began in 1980 with the opening of the Experimental Surgical Unit. Since then, the unit has continued to grow and have held microsurgical training courses biannually. The road to becoming a full-fledged reconstructive surgeon requires the mastering of both microvascular as well as flap raising techniques and requires time, patience and good training facilities. In Singapore, over the past 2 decades, we have had the opportunity to develop good training facilities and to refine our surgical education programmes in reconstructive microsurgery. In this article, we share our experience with training in reconstructive microsurgery.

description472=A discussion of the language and literacy situation in Singapore looks at the role of each of the four official languages (English, Mandarin Chinese, Tamil, and Malay) and at trends and issues in adult and vocational education for labor force development. Usage patterns of each official language, common dialects and varieties and their use, and the politics of language planning are outlined. The role of ethnic groups in determining language use is considered. Literacy patterns for each of the official languages are examined and factors affecting literacy are noted, including educational policy, social changes, development of the global marketplace, and historical and socioeconomic factors across and within language groups. The evolution and influence of public policy concerning bilingualism are noted. Vocational and adult education systems are described. Issues related to literacy and workforce development are explored, focusing on the two directions from which they are currently being addressed\: the school curriculum, and adult and vocational education. Issues discussed include competition between languages, even within the school context, the effects of multilingualism, and the relevance to the workplace of the literacy skill being taught.

description471=This paper relates the experiences of an early childhood professor from the Freie University of Berlin on a trip through East Asia to provide advice and assistance on the situational approach to preschool education. Impressions of the sociopolitical and educational environment and needs of Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines are presented. It describes the educational and social problems in these nations, as well as the attitudes of local teachers, administrators, government officials, parents, and children. Among the impressions noted are\: (1) the planners and inspectors at the workshop in Bangkok were not prepared to accept an imported package to meet their needs and wanted to develop an indigenous solution; (2) the relationship between the Thai village parents and the schools is adversarial; (3) the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese control will have drastic implications for Hong Kong preschoolers, who are neither British nor Chinese; (4) preschools in Hong Kong are based on rigid drills and standardized exams; (5) the variety of religions in Indonesia is a significant factor for preschool development; (6) Indonesian preschools adapt primary school curricula; (7) Singapore schools resemble those of Hong Kong, with rote drills and standardized tests; (8) well-educated Singapore mothers are rewarded by being allowed to have more than one child; (9) in Malaysia, language, class, and race all impinge upon preschool education; and (10) in the Philippines, poverty, malnutrition, prostitution, and a guerrilla war require many different approaches to preschool development.

description469=Financial responsibilities topped with student loans and other investments along with side hustling. Indeed, being a millennial, you have a lot in mind. And stress might haunt you when filing your own taxes. You’ve probably heard this lot of times before but even experts find it important to contribute on your 401(K) plan to save on taxes and to invest for your retirement. Southbourne Group had been committed to strive and give guidance on this venture and in this article - the company aims to give millennial some basic guidelines on how to reduce tax-time stress. Remember the deadline for filing taxes like it’s your own birthdate. Do important things related to your taxes way before the deadline. Decide whether to fully file your taxes, ask for an extension, or apply for a payment loan. It’s given that without a proper extension notice on missing the deadline, you are reliable for penalties, interest and late fees. Think about having the right tax software. Having a simple tax situation can also mean being able to use a DIY tax software program in filing your taxes easily. IRS provides free software to people who have $64,000 or less income to help them file their taxes at no charge. Write off expenses used on your side hustle. Filing taxes for your day job can be easy but if you’re also doing side hustling there are particular things to consider. Side hustle expenses (e. g. equipment or supplies) can be written off and such costs can be deducted on your tax return, reducing your taxable income. Take full advantage of education tax savings. Costs related to education are mostly tax deductible, but if you’re still unsure on this matter, you can get the professional help of a tax expert or follow the prompts of the tax software. List all your higher education expenses to identify which one you’re qualified for. Inquire about the saver’s credit. In order to encourage people to put money on a retirement account, IRS offers a tax credit called saver’s credit. At the end of the year, your tax bill could be greatly reduced with this. It also determined by your adjusted gross income the amount you are qualified for. Looking for a new job and its costs could also be deducted. If your new job is in your current career field, you can claim this tax deduction. Mark your calendar and give enough time to prepare for filing your taxes. Southbourne Tax Group expects that you will be organized on your schedule and be responsible for doing things properly. Calculations should be done with careful thought and attention. Small miscalculations or errors could cause huge mistakes. You can also rely on DIY tax programs and its built-in features to make sure that your tax information is correct, however, always do a final checking yourself. Southbourne Group needs you to learn about the deductions and credits you might be qualified for as well. Relying on free resources in filing your taxes can also be helpful. At the end of the day, it would be better not to panic and simply do everything you can to prepare beforehand.

description468=The Institutional Position of Seaports\: An International Comparison Author\: Henrik Stevens Published by Springer Netherlands ISBN\: 978-0-7923-5979-1 DOI\: 10.1007/978-0-585-35323-4 Table of Contents\: Introduction to the Study The Regulation of Responsibilities The Nature of Seaports The Port of Rotterdam The Ports of Antwerp and Hamburg Ports in the United States Canada\: the Port of Vancouver Japan\: the Port of Kobe The Port of Hong Kong The Port of Singapore South Africa\: the Port of Durban The Learning Capacity of Seaports\nIncludes bibliographical references and index\nPrint version record\nThe Institutional Position of Seaports deals with the logic and functioning of international seaport administration. This volume not only contains interesting reading for public and private port administrators and managers but can offer by its international comparisons relevant insights for the deregulation, privatisation, liberalisation and deconcentration of former government duties. Every seaport hosts different port activities in which public and private actors interact in changing relations. There is a permanent question of how responsibilities among public port administrators and the private users of the port have been divided and institutionally anchored. The unique model of analysis as used in this research has been built up by the distinction in four different control relations between state and market. By means of this institutional model the division of responsibilities for nautical control, port planning and port services can be determined. The reader can also learn via this model about the specific conditions that are needed to activate the learning capabilities of the different port activities. The model of analysis can be applied to every seaport in the world. Audience\: This book is essential for everyone who is in a public or private managing or policy-making position in a seaport. It can also be of great help to students in disciplines like maritime economics, strategic management, social geography and public administration; for example, to make them more aware of the specific role divisions and mechanisms between state and market in international seaports\n

description458="March 1996."\nThesis advisor(s)\: Donald L. Walters, Anthony A. Atchley\nThesis (M.S. in Physics) Naval Postgraduate School, March 1996\nBibliography\: p. 77\nThis thesis investigated a laboratory synthetic aperture sonar designed to test the algorithms and techniques needed to detect, classify and identify minelike objects. Previous synthetic aperture sonar work at NPS achieved 5 cm range resolution and 1 cm azimuth resolution. This thesis developed a pulsed, frequency modulated, synthetic aperture sonar that achieved range and azimuth resolutions of about 1 cm. The processed images clearly reveal targets with a high degree of certainty. However, the ability to classify and identify mines and rocks is less certain because of speckle and glint effects. The high resolution algorithms improved the detection and overall image quality of targets, and achieved a signal to noise ratio of 35 dB. The 2\:1 frequency spread of the FM chirp increased the signal to noise ratio by 20 dB compared to an unfocused synthetic aperture system. However, a significant finding is that resolution alone is not sufficient to classify and identify minelike targets in complex backgrounds. Resolution of this problem will require a different approach such as utilizing adaptive acoustic daylight to avoid the speckle and glint problems inherent with coherent illumination. To achieve a classification and identification capability, a completely different approach to acoustic illumination and signal processing is needed\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem Requirements\: Adobe Acrobat reader\nRepublic of Singapore Navy author\nupdated dlb 12/21/06\n

description457="Singapore Math" is a collection of math curricula originally developed by Singapore's Ministry of Education and private textbook publishers for use in Singapore schools. "Singapore Math" curricula were developed under a national framework centered on problem solving that emphasizes computational skills as well as conceptual and strategic thinking processes. Compared to many U.S. textbooks, "Singapore Math" textbooks, particularly those intended for earlier grades, tend to provide more in-depth coverage of a relatively small number of topics. Curricula for the secondary level follow an integrated approach, where concepts and examples from algebra and geometry are introduced progressively at each grade level. The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) identified 12 studies of Singapore Math that were published or released between 1983 and 2008. Six studies are out of scope of the review protocol because they have an ineligible design; the other six are out of scope of the review protocol for other reasons. The lack of studies meeting WWC evidence standards means that, at this time, the WWC is unable to draw any conclusions based on research about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of "Singapore Math."

description456=The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) have been developed in response to the criticism that students in the U.S. are graduating from high school without being college and career ready and that they are falling behind their counterparts in other countries in key subject areas. In this work, the authors report the results of an efficacy study that investigated the impact of Math in Focus\: Singapore Math ("MIF")--developed by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) that, according to the program developer, provides comprehensive support for CCSS. The research questions are as follows\: (1) Is there a positive impact of MIF on student skills in mathematics problem solving?; (2) Is there a positive impact of "MIF" on student math procedural skills?; and (3) Is "MIF" differentially effective in its impact on student achievement depending on (1) the ethnicity of the student? (2) the incoming achievement level of the student? The research took place during the 2011-2012 school year across twelve elementary schools in one urban school district in Nevada. Ninety-three teachers of grades 3, 4 and 5 were recruited to participate in the study, with 41 teachers randomized to the "MIF" group and 52 teachers randomized to the control group. Rosters were provided for 2235 students in participating teachers' classrooms. The design was a group randomized trial lasting one year. A two-level hierarchical linear regression model to estimate the impacts of "MIF" on student achievement. The study gives preliminary evidence concerning the impact of one CCSS-aligned math intervention on student performance on two mathematics strands. Tables are appended.

description451=Preservice teacher education curriculum development in Singapore has had to confront the problem of more closely integrating theory with practice. In an effort to do this, the foundational studies curriculum was established in the National Institute of Education in Singapore. Foundational studies covers a broad range of compulsory subjects, such as educational philosophy, psychology, sociology, and certain required academic subjects. The paper describes attempts to bridge the theory-practice gap, using three historical phases of teacher education development in Singapore as the framework. The three phases are\: (1) pre-1972, dominated by a traditional training model; (2) 1973-1981, characterized by change and qualitative improvements in the training curriculum; and (3) 1982-June 1990, marked by an effort to integrate programs and the introduction of the practicum curriculum. The latest revisions to the foundational studies curriculum include development of a course, "Principles, Issues and Practices in Education (PIPE)." The course is designed to provide a firm grounding in the theoretical underpinnings of sound educational practices crucial to the development of creative and reflective teaching and responsible professional conduct.

description445=This issue of Asian South Pacific Bureau of Adult Education Courier Service focuses on communications within the region. The first paper discusses development and communication and the training needs for workers in these areas. The next two items briefly address how broadcasting for nonformal education is being approached in Indonesia, which started a pilot project in 1977, and in Thailand, which started a Radio Correspondence project in 1978. The Technical Report of the Seminar on Planning and Management of Mass Media for Nonformal Education Programs in SEAMEO and Associate Member Countries (Singapore, November 27-December 5, 1978) is then reproduced in full. The next article reports progress of the Lingap ng Pangulo sa Barangay, a school-on-the-air program commenced in 1977 in the Philippines. The following three articles are extracts from papers concerning nonformal education broadcasting in Pakistan\: (1) description of the Programms for Farmers, (2) evaluation of the results of an ongoing Adult Functional Literacy Project (AFLP) utilizing television at Community Viewing Centers, and (3) a followup of people who undertook the AFLP program. The issue concludes with two articles on problems of obtaining material in Western Samoa and on a recent seminar and workshop in Thailand for senior broadcast managers. (YLB)

description443=An attempt is made to trace the history of every major library in Malay and Singapore. Social and recreational club libraries are not included, and school libraries are not extensively covered. Although it is possible to trace the history of Malaysia's libraries back to the first millenium of the Christian era, there are few written records pre-dating World War II. The lack of documentation on the early periods of library history creates an emphasis on developments in the modern period. This is not out of order since it is only recently that libraries in West Malaysia and Singapore have been recognized as one of the important media of mass education. Lack of funds, failure to recognize the importance of libraries, and problems caused by the federal structure of government are blamed for this delay in development. Hinderances to future development are the lack of trained librarians, problems of having to provide material in several different languages, and the lack of national bibliographies, union catalogs and lists of serials.

description441=Two studies are reported, comparing the browser loading times of webpages created using common Web development techniques. The loading speeds were estimated in 12 Asian countries by members of the "PANdora" network, funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) to conduct collaborative research in the development of effective distance education (DE) practices. An online survey tool with stopwatch-type counter was used. Responses were obtained from Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. In most of the survey conditions, browser loading times were noted up to four times slower than commonly prescribed as acceptable. Failure of pages to load at all was frequent. The speediest loading times were observed when the online material was hosted locally, and was created either in the "Docebo" learning management system (LMS), or in the HTML option provided by the "Moodle" LMS. It is recommended that formative evaluation of this type should become standard practice in the selection and use of online programming techniques, in order to preserve the accessibility of the World-Wide-Web across large geographical distances, as for DE in the developing world.

description440=This paper examines assumptions about second language acquisition, bilingualism, and language planning that underlie Singapore's bilingual education policy, noting how the experience in Singapore illuminates current theories in second language acquisition and language planning. In Singapore, English is promoted as the "working language," while Mandarin, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil are considered mother tongues of the major ethnic groups. In the late 1970s, the government adopted a bilingual education policy which requires that all students study their subject matter curriculum in English and all students achieve proficiency in their mother tongue. Singapore's national exams usually show upward trends for all ethnic groups, though there is an achievement gap between the Chinese majority and the Malay and Indian minority groups. Although Chinese students consistently outperform the other groups, and a greater proportion move on to higher education, each ethnic group shows strengths in different areas. Singapore's language policy reflects many common assumptions about language learning (e.g., beginning a second language early leads to higher proficiency). It also reflects many assumptions concerning language planning (e.g., language is a tool that should be carefully chosen for its utility to the national interest). (Contains 38 references.) (SM)

description427=This document contains three papers on improving learning with technology. "The Benefits, Challenges, and Implications of Teleworking\: A Literature Review" (Susan R. Madsen) reviews the literature on the benefits and challenges of teleworking for individuals, work groups, and organizations and investigates the implications of telework for human resource development (HRD) theory and practice. The report presents eight recommendations for HRD practitioners, including the following\: (1) be prepared to design approaches to evaluate, educate, organize, and inform workers; (2) train workers to adapt to a new environment and cope with its challenges; and (3) train mangers to monitor telecommuting programs carefully and react in an expedient manner to correct any undesirable consequences. "A Study of e-Learning Practices in Selected Fortune 100 Companies" (Danielle Strazzo, Tim L. Wentling) reports the results of a survey that examined why 7 Fortune 100 companies have introduced e-learning to their employees. The future of e-learning is also discussed. "Human Resource Development for International Technology Transfer within Multinational Enterprises in Singapore" (Aahad M. Osman-Gani) presents empirical information on the status of international technology transfer and the HRD practices used in the transfer process. Two papers include substantial bibliographies. (MN)

description426=This study examined the nature and impact of two aspects of classroom learning (interpersonal teacher behavior and classroom climate) on the affective and cognitive outcomes of elementary mathematics students in Singapore. A secondary purpose was to explore gender differences in students' achievement, attitudes, and perceptions of the classroom environment. A random sample of 1,512 boys and girls from government elementary schools was used. For the analysis of environment-outcome associations, simple, multiple, and canonical correlation analyses and multilevel (hierarchical linear model) analyses were conducted using two units of analysis, the individual student and the class mean. For the analysis of gender differences, multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) for repeated measures were performed for the two outcome measures and the classroom environment scales. Overall the different methods of analysis yielded consistent associations between classroom environment and student outcomes. Gender differences were detected in mathematics achievement in favor of boys, but girls generally viewed their classroom environment more favorably than the boys did. (Author)
description425=This Seminar, held in Singapore June 9-14, 1969, brought together some of the leading scholars in the field of language teaching, from both within and outside the Southeast Asian region, for the following purposes\: (1) to review some of the more significant developments of the past two decades in language teaching; (2) to consider some of the newer concepts, particularly those developed out of transformational grammar; (3) to provide a platform for the exchange of ideas stemming from the various schools of linguistics and methodology; and (4) to stimulate critical thinking among the language teaching professionals of the SEAMEO (Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization) countries. A noteworthy feature of the Seminar was the emphasis of most speakers on the need for eclecticism; there was agreement among the theoretical linguists and the practicing teachers present that the best results in language teaching were likely to be achieved by taking insights into language and teaching strategies of proven value from every available source. Summaries of all the 35 papers, with some account of the subsequent discussions, are presented in this Report. A number of the papers will be published in full in a forthcoming first issue of the RELC (Regional English Language Centre) Journal. For earlier reports, see AL 002 147 and AL 002 148. (AMM)
description424=Background\: Singapore launched the first Masterplan in 1997 to guide the integration of ICT (information and communication technology) in education. Since then many schools have started to explore using ICT in their curricula. The school reported in this paper developed a web-based learning environment to assist students in the use of ICT. However, a number of problems were identified with the English version learning environment. The Mother Tongue Department in this school decided to develop a Chinese version web-based learning environment to help students in essay writing. Aims\: The aim of this study was to develop an interactive online portal that is more practical for students to write essays in Chinese. Specifically, the Chinese version learning environment aimed to\: i) encourage the use of Chinese language; ii) promote student's interaction with peers and with the teacher; iii) allow the teacher to control the quality of students' posts; and iv) provide a more user-friendly environment for both students and teachers. Sample\: In the third round of prototyping, 110 students were surveyed. They were all girls of 14 years old. Majority of them (74%) used English as the first language at home. The others spoke Mandarin or dialects at home. Five of them were selected for an interview based on the survey results. Method\: A survey and a face-to-face interview were conducted. The data collected from the survey questionnaire were tabulated, and the interview results were described. Results\: The results found that students posted longer essays with fewer spelling mistakes. The students were satisfied with the content, tools and interface of the environment. However, not all students enjoyed online learning and their Hanyu Pinyin skills needed to be further improved. Conclusion\: The action research approach is useful for school teachers to design a complicated system that has not been fully articulated. The design processes of the CL Portal reveals that the action research approach allows a research team to gradually revise a system based on the comments collected and eventually produce an optimal product.

description423=There are lessons for Australia in the key approaches to the development, approval, maintenance and quality assurance of qualifications adopted in countries overseas. This research takes into account a range of approaches used in selected European Union (EU) member states (Germany, Finland and Sweden), the United Kingdom (England, Northern Ireland and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland) and the nations of New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea. The processes used in Ontario, Canada, and selected accreditation agencies in the United States were also investigated. This work serves to inform the vocational education and training (VET) sector in Australia about practices used overseas. It provides a useful reference document for agencies charged with developing and reviewing qualifications and showcases the different approaches used to ensure that qualifications remain current for the industries they serve. This report highlights some key messages for Australia, some of which include\: (1) The introduction of qualifications frameworks, implementation of competency-based or learning outcomes approaches to learning and assessment, recognition of prior learning, and effective regulation and quality assurance processes are all being debated overseas, with varying solutions to the perceived issues being applied; (2) The development of hierarchical national qualifications frameworks comprising progressively higher qualification levels is relatively widespread, and increasing; and (3) Collaboration between governments (or their delegated agencies) and industry stakeholders is key to developing and/or approving competency standards, educational standards and content that align with labour market needs. The following are appended\: (1) The criteria for SQA accreditation of qualifications; and (2) Standards for the ACCSC in the United States. [This report has been prepared by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER) under the National Vocational Education and Training Research (NVETR) Program.]
description422=This paper discusses recent histories of labor shortages in Singapore, Japan, and several western European countries. Emphasis is upon the economic effects of severe shortages of labor. Fearing that these shortages would seriously handicap further economic progress, many people in these countries have advocated large-scale immigration or increased population growth or both. It is the author's conclusion that the existence of a labor shortage is not a valid ground for encouraging either population growth or immigration. The series of which this publication is a part is intended to increase understanding of the interrelationships between population growth and socioeconomic and cultural patterns throughout the world, and to communicate this understanding to scholars and policy makers.

description421=Recent research on Literature education in Singapore has highlighted the state of ambivalence of the Literature curriculum (Choo, 2004); suggested possibilities for its reconceptualisation, taking into consideration the environment and impact of globalisation (Holden, 2000; Choo, 2011); and considered the offering of alternative curricula (Poon, 2007). An exploration into the state of Literature as a subject in Singapore secondary schools in relation to this recent research was carried out, by considering the role of Literature in the current political, economic, social and educational climate. This paper presents the findings and analysis of students' perspectives, obtained through in-depth interpretivist case studies conducted at five sites, purposively selected to incorporate the range of school types in Singapore. Data collection methods included focus group interviews, written protocol and document analysis. Emergent themes included\: the insignificant impact of local literature on the study of Literature, the low status and the lack of desirability of Literature as a course of study, which led to the formulation of four key propositions supporting development of theory on ways in which students deal with Literature in English studies in Singapore secondary schools. The findings drawn from original empirical data from students have implications for theory, policy and practice. (Contains 5 footnotes.)

description419=This paper examines the experience of development in the advanced developing countries in Asia from a gender perspective and draws some lessons for women in development policy in middle income countries in the Asian and Near East regions. The nature of the paper is exploratory, asking many questions on which further research and information are needed. The policy recommendations also are tentative. The data analysis is primarily from the four counties of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. All are in the middle or upper national income level category, in world terms. Some data also are presented for Thailand, the Philippines, Egypt, and Jordan to indicate certain inter-country differences in women's economic status. The pattern of rapid economic growth in the four most advanced developing countries (4MADC) has been linked causally to a greater extent than usually is acknowledged with women's economic participation. These economies studied have a very high proportion of women in the formal labor force in general and in the industrial work force in particular. Work force participation by women in these countries reflects the export intensity of production in the industrial sector, and the fact that worldwide, expansion of export manufacturing by developing countries has demanded and created a female workforce. This paper includes an executive summary, seven chapters, and a bibliography. (EH)

(2) What are the monetary and nonmonetary costs and benefits of this expansion? (3) Is this expansion warranted by or necessary for economic growth? (4) If the expansion is unwarranted, what steps can government and universities take to reduce the pressures for expansion, while still supplying vital skills needed for development? (Author/LBH)

description408=In many things, when we see the price is high, we immediately assume that it is top notch in quality. Yet, experts strongly advise that we should not be blinded by the price tag alone since it is usually not an indication on the longevity or the robustness of the certain material, well, at least when we are shopping for our upholstery fabrics. The price may signify other things such as the intricacies of designs, the sophistication of the pattern, high aesthetic value or the particularly refinement or lustre.  To identify the worth and the quality of the fabric of your upholstery furnishing, the Peterson Group , one of the leading suppliers of high quality fabrics introduces the most common upholstery and its characteristics\: Velour Velour is a combination of all fabrics for which yarns is woven into basic material.  With a certain process, the yarn is turned into a wear resistant fiber. This type is basically the experts’ favorite since it promises long sustenance. Very rarely can you see fraud copies of this kind of fabric as it is intricately woven and cannot be easily done by just anyone. Also, velours are easily identifiable. When it is impacted by pressure and body, it slightly changes, thus the change in lustre which is also commonly its complaint.  Flat Woven Fabric According to Polster Services\: A review of upholstery, Flat woven fabric is a term used for fabric types constructed from two sets of threads crossed at right angles. Normal seating alone can result in “pillings” developing on the fabric‘s surface. In technical terminology this is called pilling formation. For flat woven fabric, printed colors may easily lighten its color intensity with the exposure to light or in simple terms, the fabric can easily fade. For this reason, it should not be exposed to too much sunlight.  Microfibre Fabrics Technically, these types of covering materials are made up of a combination of microscopic fibres constructed in a complicated pattern and arrangement of fibres, of which 10, 000 meters of fabrics weighs between 0.08-1.2 grams. From this pure synthetic fibre, knitted materials as well as upholstery can be manufactured. Because of its complex patterns and manufacturing procedures, it has a high level of wear resistance. The largest manufacturing companies of these synthetic fabrics are China, Bangkok, Thailand and Jakarta, Indonesia.

description405=In December, 2012 I went on a ten day ride around northern Myanmar with two other riders. I crash-landed on my head after a few days with the engine shut off, putting myself out of action and risking my life in the Shan countryside. Evacuation to Singapore with multiple fractures and a collapsed lung took two painful days. Here’s the delightful start and agonizing ending, with photos of Yangon, Mandalay, and Shan states … and inside a Myanmar hospital.

description398=Aztec Group Inc. Florida Singapore Hong Kong Kuala Lumpur Real Estate Investment Review   Often, we see companies that have gained great success claim that their accomplishments were due to their professional teams of workers who diligently apply their expertise in a consistent manner for many years. And this is almost always the case and it can be established as the underlying fact in all cases. Yet, if we come to think of it, professionalism can be learned and gained through years of training and inculcation by the best mentors using the best principles and instruments of education without the person himself or herself completely accepting the ultimate motive for the whole process.   What do we mean by that?   Consider the soldier who goes through boot camp. All the hard training and discipline is equally delivered to this soldier as well as to every other soldier in an entire army. We end up with a well-organized and well-trained army, complete with the latest weaponry available. But still, that does not assure that army that it will win all the battles it will engage in. A more superior army, not just in number but in performance under particular circumstances can gain victory because of the overall comprehension of the factors that make for a victorious assault against an enemy force.   The individual matters, whether in an army or a business company. However, what matters more is the way the individual parts are managed and controlled in order to achieve the common goal for the entire team, not just for the individual. A soldier may be able to shoot so many enemies; but if the enemy ends up gaining more grounds as a result, the individual score does not matter. You may have the highest shooter in your basketball team and yet lose the game.   Professionalism or efficiency is not just in the outward performance of one's tasks but in the heart. It is an internal quality that permeates the entire organization and allows the whole organization to behave like an organism it was meant to function.   The bee colony is the best example we can present. Each bee is a perfect carrier of the colony's culture. It maintains the optimum efficiency in terms of hunting and harvesting honey. Each bee not only has the capability to smell out nectar-heavy flowers, it also has the skills to assist other bees to avoid inefficient moves. We know now that a bee, after harvesting nectar from a certain flower, marks that flower as already empty through a scent it leaves, warning others to bypass it.   True professionalism, therefore, allows workers to smell out the best clients and to tell others that bad clients are around and must be avoided. It also goes with possible bad decisions or bad investment choices that may be encountered along the way.   Such skills can be acquired through training, we must admit. But it takes extra passion, not just training, to develop the level of capability that allows people to overcome greater challenges and accept more intense risks in order to achieve higher goals not ordinarily taken by other people. It is the extra edge in innovative and entrepreneurial power that determines the best from the good.   Genuine professionalism is of the heart, not just of the mind. Understand how the heart works and you gain that edge over those who merely teach. Why? Because the heart requires deeper care and greater imagination, not just mere knowledge and routine.   Aztec understands the way to a successful organization. People matter and they need to be recognized and rewarded accordingly. But for those who are truly professional at heart, the compensation comes before the reward. The challenge of the work, the doing of the work and the completion of the work are one and the same. Like the hunter who smells and hears the kill even before it is seen, the adventure and joy of doing something comes with the doing itself.   Everyone who does his or her best is rewarded by having done what must be done as well as the actual material gains acquired. But the heart that already knows beforehand the outcome is at peace and content even before the actual doing. That is genuine and extraordinary professionalism.

description396=We know almost all people are in fear of dying. Too harsh of a topic to start this article with but it is true. Death is imminent in every second of the day, everywhere in the world. We cannot do anything to prevent it but we can find ways to prepare for it. Taking the warning at heart, there exist insurance companies. Almost all people now have their own life insurance. The foremost importance of this is to provide for those you left behind. This is extremely important if you are the head of the family. Industry experts say that your life insurance should be ten times your yearly income.   In the most populous countries in the world, life insurances are a must since they are also encountering high death rates each day with the continuous growth of their number. Indonesia, for instance, where 9.764 million of its people live in its capital, Jakarta has a death rate of 6.34% according to indexmundi.com. For now, accident insurance in Jakarta is the primary priority since the city is the accident capital of the world with a person dying every 90 seconds. But what happens to those they leave behind?   Importance Even if you do not have any material things or other assets to pass to your children or grand children, you can create an inheritance by buying a life insurance and naming them as beneficiaries. Your children would not be therefore left destitute but instead have a solid future before them.   You can also pay off debts and other expenses when you have life insurance in your aid. You do not want your children or spouse be left behind with extra expenses they need to problem with, do you?   Types The two basic types of life insurance are the Traditional Whole Life or the Term Life. Simply explained, the former is that which you continue to pay for the rest of your life while the latter is a policy set for a specific time. In availing which one may suit your taste, you can consult a financial advisor to discuss in detail the benefits, advantages and disadvantage of each. About Axis Capital Axis Capital is a group of insurance and reinsurance companies based in Bermuda but with different branches from Singapore, United Kingdom, Australia and on more than ten states in America. We have been providing clients and distribution partners with a broad range of specialized risk transfer products and service over the years.

description394=Singapore is an array of different cultures blended harmoniously. And therefore, the country's food culture lacks nothing else. What's magnificent to see is how SG placed its street food as one of its heritage and culture. They even celebrate an annual Singapore Food Festival in celebration of street food. A couple of stalls have also earned a Michelin star\! Travelers Today takes you directly to the streets. Along the streets of Little India, one can find Chaat, a street savory vegetarian snack that contains potatoes, delicious yogurt, and a couple of spices. There are also lots of roti or naan along the way. A trip to the Mustafa Centre and Tekka Centre is worthwhile as you try various street food with costs starting from S$0.35 to not more than S$10. If you ask us, we go gaga over their Biryani and masala teh. Singapore's Chinatown Food Complex is where you get the best seat and a line of hawkers willing to serve you. In fact, you can find the famed Michelin star food street here. The Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle is available for S$2. It wasn't an award-winning stall when we came there, though. And we failed to eat their chunks as they have plenty of people lining up. Maybe next year. Expect to pay S$1 to S$5 in Chinatown for a bowl of noodles, dumplings, beef, liver and more. You can find various international dishes that range from Sri Lanka to Arab Nations at Kampong Glam. Shawarma, curry, and veggies are common here. Prices are very affordable. Some won't cost you much than S$5. There are also a couple of roti and naan along the way. We just grabbed one and off our way. By the way, some are self-service. You grab a plate then you can choose from an array of 20 dishes. We stayed in a cat café though. How about, before leaving the airport, you get to taste some street food at Changi Village Food Centre? They said it has been renovated now and is much cleaner than before. You can have satay of mutton, fish or pork worth S$0.50 to S$2. Oyster omelets are served for S$5 and going up while fritters are available up to S$1.

description393=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: Germline defects of mismatch repair (MMR) genes underlie Lynch Syndrome (LS). We aimed to gain comprehensive genetic and epigenetic profiles of LS families in Singapore, which will facilitate efficient molecular diagnosis of LS in Singapore and the region. Methods\: Fifty nine unrelated families were studied. Mutations in exons, splice-site junctions and promoters of five MMR genes were scanned by high resolution melting assay followed by DNA sequencing, large fragment deletions/duplications and promoter methylation in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 were evaluated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) was assessed with five mononucleotide markers and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) was also performed. Results\: Pathogenic defects, all confined to MLH1 and MSH2, were identified in 17 out of 59 (28.8%) families. The mutational spectrum was highly heterogeneous and 28 novel variants were identified. One recurrent mutation in MLH1 (c.793C>T) was also observed. 92.9% sensitivity for indication of germline mutations conferred by IHC surpassed 64.3% sensitivity by MSI. Furthermore, 15.6% patients with MSS tumors harbored pathogenic mutations. Conclusions\: Among major ethnic groups in Singapore, all pathogenic germline defects were confined to MLH1 and MSH2. Caution should be applied when the Amsterdam criteria and consensus microsatellite marker panel recommended in the revised Bethesda guidelines are applied to the local context. We recommend a screening strategy for the local LS by starting with tumor IHC and the hotspot mutation testing at MLH1 c.793C>T followed by comprehensive mutation scanning in MLH1 and MSH2 prior to proceeding to other MMR genes.

description392=An essay on use of cooperative learning (CL) techniques in the second language classroom looks at the benefits of CL, examines the current status of their use, particularly in Singapore, and makes recommendations for implementing CL techniques in second language reading instruction. The discussion begins with a review of literature on group instruction and group activities in second language teaching, and looks at how group activities are, first, incorporated into second language curriculum plans and instructional materials and then implemented in the classroom. Singapore's situation is highlighted here. A second section looks at what distinguishes CL group instruction approach and its potential to improve group activities. Five advantageous features of CL are noted\: positive interdependence; individual accountability; collaborative skills; use of group time to process interactions; and heterogeneous grouping. Variables in task design that affect language learning are also discussed briefly. Three ways to increase the use of CL in reading instruction are outlined and explored\: (1) inclusion of CL in pre- and inservice teacher education; (2) incorporation of CL activities in teachers' instructional materials; and (3) inclusion of CL activities in student materials. Several specific classroom techniques and procedures are noted. Contains 19 references. (MSE)

description390=This paper presents case studies of two teachers at Crescent Girl's School (an all-girls high school in Singapore) who implemented strategies learned through a teacher professional development program called 21st Century Learning Design (21CLD). Policymakers often state requirements for teachers to focus on 21st century (21C) competencies without providing them with the necessary pedagogical support and training needed to support students in developing these competencies. 21CLD fills this gap by offering concrete rubrics, definitions and examples in six "dimensions" that each relate to a 21C competency--collaboration, real-world problem-solving and innovation, knowledge construction, use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for learning, skilled communication, and self-regulation--to support teachers as they build these ideas into their lessons. In this paper we provide evidence of the influence of 21CLD on two teachers' instructional practice. The first case study describes a science teacher's experience using the 21CLD frame to revise a lesson to focus more deeply on developing students' collaboration skills. The second case study highlights a mathematics teacher's experience with developing and implementing a new mathematics lesson to develop students' real world problem-solving skills. These case studies highlight the valuable role that 21CLD has played in enhancing teachers' instructional practice by providing a common language and understanding of 21C competencies, and supporting a vibrant and dynamic professional learning community.

description386=This article is from BMC Medical Research Methodology , volume 11 . Abstract Background\: Physical activity patterns of a population remain mostly assessed by the questionnaires. However, few physical activity questionnaires have been validated in Asian populations. We previously utilized a combination of different questionnaires to assess leisure time, transportation, occupational and household physical activity in the Singapore Prospective Study Program (SP2). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) has been developed for a similar purpose. In this study, we compared estimates from these two questionnaires with an objective measure of physical activity in a multi-ethnic Asian population. Methods\: Physical activity was measured in 152 Chinese, Malay and Asian Indian adults using an accelerometer over five consecutive days, including a weekend. Participants completed both the physical activity questionnaire in SP2 (SP2PAQ) and IPAQ long form. 43subjects underwent a second set of measurements on average 6 months later to assess reproducibility of the questionnaires and the accelerometer measurements. Spearman correlations were used to evaluate validity and reproducibility and correlations for validity were corrected for within-person variation of accelerometer measurements. Agreement between the questionnaires and the accelerometer measurements was also evaluated using Bland Altman plots. Results\: The corrected correlation with accelerometer estimates of energy expenditure from physical activity was better for the SP2PAQ (vigorous activity\: r \= 0.73; moderate activity\: r \= 0.27) than for the IPAQ (vigorous activity\: r \= 0.31; moderate activity\: r \= 0.15). For moderate activity, the corrected correlation between SP2PAQ and the accelerometer was higher for Chinese (r \= 0.38) and Malays (r \= 0.57) than for Indians (r \= -0.09). Both questionnaires overestimated energy expenditure from physical activity to a greater extent at higher levels of physical activity than at lower levels of physical activity. The reproducibility for moderate activity (accelerometer\: r \= 0.68; IPAQ\: r \= 0.58; SP2PAQ\: r \= 0.55) and vigorous activity (accelerometer\: 0.52; IPAQ\: r \= 0.38; SP2PAQ\: r \= 0.75) was moderate to high for all instruments. Conclusion\: The agreement between IPAQ and accelerometer measurements of energy expenditure from physical activity was poor in our Asian study population. The SP2PAQ showed good validity and reproducibility for vigorous activity, but performed less well for moderate activity particularly in Indians. Further effort is needed to develop questionnaires that better capture moderate activity in Asian populations.

description385=As exporters of oil in the Middle East and throughout the world, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) must address the following challenges in the area of development and economic growth\: (1) an increasingly integrated world economy in which technology and knowledge will be paramount; (2) the need to diversify its economy from a natural resource-based economy that will inevitably decline in the century ahead; and (3) the challenge of keeping the state as a political community relevant to its citizens. An examination of the UAE's situation against the backdrop of economic growth and educational issues in small countries such as Morocco, Indonesia, Malaysia, Yemen, and Singapore reveals that the responses of societies in countries with hydrocarbon-based economies to inflows of revenues are much more complicated and diversified than many authors have previously argued. The examination further reveals that, for states such as the UAE, a viable economic future is a race against time that can only be won with an integrated triangle consisting of educational policies, state actions, and maximization of economic opportunities. The key to the UAE's future depends on continued development and maintenance of a knowledge-based economy and continual reappraisal of the fundamental and traditional relationship between work, learning, and education.

description383=Fraudulence has been defined in many ways depending on where it is being used. The general idea around the term is negative and is often used interchangeably with deceitfulness or trickery. The extremity of a fraudulent act ranges from being a mere prank to risking a life. In the field of medicine, health and wellness, it can result to the latter. World Health Organization (WHO) has first used the term counterfeit to the production of counterfeit medicines. Nowadays, the use of the term fraudulent had incited numerous complaints and arguments. Debates over it have shown that other parties have considered the term to be an intellectual property, referring solely to falsely packaged products that violate trademarks regardless of the content. WHO has firmly emphasized that the organization is not only after people who steal labels. The content or the lack of it is their primary concern as it can directly harm those who are taking it. Hence, the term fraudulent is also used to describe the falsified ingredient used in the production of medicines. During the first years of its establishment, The Peterson Group, a non-profit organization campaigning against the proliferation of counterfeit medicines across the world, has had a few conducted surveys on the increasing number of fraudulent medicines circulating in less developed countries, some developing nations and a few leading regions. In its most recent survey, the number of manufacturers in China rank first in five consecutive years. With the help of authorities, more than 50 local organizations, most composed of small group of people are caught in Beijing manufacturing fake Viagra. In Jakarta, Indonesia, tools and high end technological equipment used to produce Tamiflu was found in a dilapidated building in Kota. Similar operations were held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and suburbs of Bangkok, Thailand. Not only are the labels of large pharmaceutical companies being counterfeited, the ingredients found in the medicines are far from being medicinal. Chalks, paint, beeswax, etcetera are being used as substitute for the real chemicals. It may or may not be true that the United Nations (UN) and WHO which have taken different countermeasures over the years already improved on the drug falsification control. The efforts of many nations to defeat fraudulence in their own boundaries have been the focus of each region. It can also be said that WHO had been predominating in its role of prevention of counterfeit/falsified/fraudulent medicines but it stresses the need for more intergovernmental actions.

This is the time to look forward for the home tuitions and help your child learn in a simple and an easy way. The situation is often faced by many children where they fail to understand what is being taught at the school and colleges. Tuition is the only solution in such cases. You cannot blame the system of a school or a college if your child is lagging behind. It is not possible for every teacher to pay extra attention to each and every student belonging to a class. Home Tuitions Singapore helps your child score well. What is the need of the home tuitions? A child of today’s generation has to follow strict routines and busy schedules but who will understand the teaching requirements of your child if you don’t. The most significant advantage of the home tuition process is you can set the timings and the schedules of your child as per the requirements. In this process your child is given extra attention and made to learn in a simple and easy way. Home Tuitions Singapore is one such way which will help your child think out of the box and makes him/her score in a better way. It’s quite common that people are busy and live a monotonous life but being a parent does not give you the authority to treat your child in the same way. Make them feel whatever they are doing and enjoy the learning process. What are subjects taught? The home tuitions Singapore helps your child with whatever subject he/she needs but as you can understand that it is also not possible for a single teacher to teach all the subjects so you will need to spare some time for the different subjects. The teachers giving home tuitions are experienced here and find a root cause for the problem faced by a child while studying the subjects. Don’t think that the home tuitions provide only teaching lessons to your child. You can also seek for music lessons or drawing lessons and knowing different languages too. There are several ways by which the students get benefited from the home tuitions. And it is also seen that after a certain period of time they start analyzing their own flaws and try to verify them thereafter. It is really beneficial and make them perfect in their work in future. So if you want your child score well, learn in a better way and enhance the knowledge about some other activities then this is the best option both for you and your child to go for home tuitions.

description378=A new report from the Coastal Resources Commission’s Science Panel on Coastal Hazards (SPCH) reveals that North Carolina coast is gradually getting lapped by the sea. Naturally, this is not just an issue that’s exclusive to North Carolina as climate change is resulting in stronger typhoons and worse flooding around the world — it is, however, one of the highly-prone locations. That’s according to the detailed document released by the SPCH based on tidal gauge measurements collected from Southport, Beaufort, Oregon Inlet, Duck and Wilmington. Data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also served as their basis for the 43-page report which projects higher sea levels in three decades. It predicts Duck’s sea level will increase by 4-10 inches in 2045, while Southport’s is expected to rise 2-9 inches. The Keeley Consulting Group considers the report on sea level as a critical one, especially when the coastal and homeowners welfare are taken into account. And according to Professor Stanley Riggs of Department of Geological Sciences (East Carolina University), the numbers may not sound alarming but the effects could be. “There are two different things\: One is the long-term change going on in the globe — slow, systematic. You also have the short-term. The short-term ranges from daily tides to storm surges — 5, 10, 15, 20-foot change in sea levels in hours,” Riggs said. The bottom line is, as the sea levels gradually increase, short-term effects also worsen. Therefore, he fears that many houses along the coast of North Carolina won’t even reach 30 years — if there’s no federal funding to improve the problematic areas anyway.

description377=On January 20, 2016, Singapore deposited with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) its instrument of ratification for the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, reports Lowtax.net.   With this development, Singapore became the 93rd jurisdiction to join the pact, touted by the OECD as the world's leading instrument for boosting transparency and combating offshore tax evasion.   The Convention provides for all forms of administrative assistance in tax matters\: exchange of information on request, spontaneous exchange, automatic exchange, tax examinations abroad, simultaneous tax examinations, and assistance in tax collection. It guarantees extensive safeguards for the protection of taxpayers' rights.   Ratifying the Convention will expand Singapore's network of partners for the exchange of information on request by 34 jurisdictions. This is part of a series of changes that Singapore has made in recent years to combat cross-border tax evasion, following Singapore's adoption of the internationally agreed standard for exchange of information on request in 2009, Singapore's Ministry of Finance said.   Minister for Finance, Heng Swee Keat, said\: "Ratifying the Convention reflects Singapore's commitment to effective exchange of information based on international standards, but the standards can only work if all financial centres, such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, Singapore, and Hong Kong, move together. We will continue to work with our international partners to achieve this and prevent regulatory arbitrage."   The Convention was developed jointly by the OECD and the Council of Europe in 1988. It was amended in 2010 to respond to a call by the Group of Twenty (G-20) nations that it be aligned to the new international standard on the automatic exchange of information and that it be opened up to all countries.   The Convention is now seen as the instrument for swift implementation of the new Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters developed by the OECD. It will also be critical for the automatic exchange of country-by-country reports, proposed in the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting project.

description375=This article is from Korean Journal of Urology , volume 55 . Abstract Purpose\: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of the Vienna nomogram prostate biopsy model in the detection of prostate cancer in our local population. We also assessed the incidence of complications from using such a template. Materials and Methods\: From January 2006 to June 2007, 120 men with either elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) scores (>4 ng/mL) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination were enrolled prospectively to undergo extraction of 6 to 18 cores for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, as indicated by the Vienna nomogram. Results\: The mean age was 62.6±8.3 years (range, 40-86 years). The mean PSA score was 13.42 ng/mL. The mean number of cores obtained was 9.68±3.1. According to the Vienna nomogram, 27 out of a total of 120 patients had prostate cancer, for a detection rate of 22.5%. In the group of patients with PSA scores 10 ng/mL had a detection rate of 50% (13 of 26). The complication rate in our study was 7.5%. Conclusions\: With the use of the Vienna nomogram, our prostate cancer detection rate is comparable to previously published data for Asian patients. This nomogram offers an easy tool with which to select the optimal number of prostate biopsy cores to be taken on the basis of patient age and total prostate volume. With this biopsy strategy, we also have found that the complication rate from prostate biopsy is low.

Abstract Background\: Hand hygiene compliance is generally assessed by observation of adherence to the “WHO five moments” using numbers of opportunities as the denominator. The quality of the activity is usually not monitored since there is no established methodology for the routine assessment of hand hygiene technique. The aim of this study was to objectively assess hand rub coverage of staff using a novel imaging technology and to look for patterns and trends in missed areas after the use of WHO’s 6 Step technique. Methods\: A hand hygiene education and assessment program targeted 5200 clinical staff over 7 days at the National University Hospital, Singapore. Participants in small groups were guided by professional trainers through 5 educational stations, which included technique-training and UV light assessment supported by digital photography of hands. Objective criteria for satisfactory hand hygiene quality were defined a priori. The database of images created during the assessment program was analyzed subsequently. Patterns of poor hand hygiene quality were identified and linked to staff demographic. Results\: Despite the assessment taking place immediately after the training, only 72% of staff achieved satisfactory coverage. Failure to adequately clean the dorsal and palmar aspects of the hand occurred in 24% and 18% of the instances, respectively. Fingertips were missed by 3.5% of subjects.

description369=The magnetic and electrical properties as well as the structural characteristics have been studied on a series of samples with structure substrate (Sub)/SV(1)/Al2O35nm/SV(2). Here SV(1) is either CoFe/IrMn based spin-valve (SV) such as Ta5/NiFe2/IrMn8/CoFe2/Cu2.6/CoFe2/Ta5 (thicknesses are in nanometers) bottom SV or Ta5/NiFe2/CoFe1.5/Cu2.6/CoFe2/FeMn10/Ta5 top SV and SV(2) is Ta5/NiFe2/CoFe1.5(or 2)/Cu2.6/CoFe2/IrMn8/Ta5 top SV - SV(1) and SV(2) in the structure are decoupled by a Al2O3 layer with 5 nm in the magnetic properties, however, they are in parallel connection in the electrical properties. In a sample with structure Sub/Ta5/NiFe2/IrMn8/CoFe2/Cu2.6/CoFe2/Ta5/Al2O35/Ta5/NiFe2/CoFe2/Cu2.6/CoFe2/IrMn8/Ta5, five magnetoresistance states which are related to five magnetization states have been observed after the sample was annealed at T \= 220 deg C with a field strength of 1T under high vacuum because of different interlayer coupling fields (H(sub int)) in the top and bottom CoFe/IrMn based SVs (H(int)) is about 12.21 Oe in the top CoFe/IrMn SV and 29.3 Oe in the bottom CoFe/IrMn based SV). In a sample with structure Sub/Ta5/NiFe2/CoFe1.5/Cu2.6/CoFe2/FeMn 10/Ta5/Al2035/Ta5/NiFe2/CoFe1.5/Cu2.6/CoFe2/IrMn8/Ta5, since the blocking temperature of the CoFe/FeMn based SV (T(sub b)) is about 150 deg C) is lower than that of CoFe/IrMn based SV (T(sub b)) is about 230 deg C), the spins can be easily engineered and therefore various magnetoresistance states can be obtained when the sample is magnetically annealed at different temperatures in a proper annealing sequence. By properly selecting materials and controlling the magnetically annealing conditions, multilevel giant magnetoresistance (MR) magnetic random access memory (MRAM) cell can be realized, which will significantly improve the MRAM data storage density without increasing any additional processing complexity.

description363=This paper discusses the results of a study that investigated whether there are any significant differences in political leadership potential and willingness to lead among three groups of Singapore students from the Gifted Education Program (GEP) (n\=86), the best Express Stream class (n\=74), and the weakest Express Stream class (n\=61). Data were collected through the use of a self-constructed questionnaire that measured potential for leadership, willingness to lead, expectations of national leaders, influence of parents, and influence of school. The findings of the study show that there were no significant differences in willingness to lead when the respondents were compared by educational stream or by sex. However, in terms of leadership potential, a significant difference was found to exist between males and females, with females showing a lead over the males. In conclusion, there was no significant difference between the streams, showing that the GEP students did not have higher leadership potential than their Express Stream counterparts. (Author/CR)

description362=Westhill Consulting Travel and Tours , Singapore\: What NOT TO DO When Travelling Abroad Alcohol and Islam\: Alcohol is normally prohibited in Muslim countries and if Muslims drink they won't do so in public so don't humiliate them with a gift of a bottle of any sort of alcohol. This is not cool in such places like Jakarta Indonesia, in UAE and many more. Dogs and pigs are unclean animals in Islamic countries, as per their tradition, so your faux pas can be even larger when you offer a Muslim alcohol in a handmade pigskin bottle holder. Public displays of affection\: Warning public display of affection such as kissing are not allowed in places like Dubai or Jakarta, Indonesia while sex outside marriage is illegal in the whole of the UAE.  Thumbs up or OK\: in Iran a thumbs-up is called bilakh and means an unquestioned insult. Literally, it means “Sit on this” while in Brazil this gesture tells the other person that you are comparing him or her to a part of the human anatomy best not mentioned. Patting someone's head — is a gesture of affection but not in Europe, patting a child on the head is demeaning if done to an adult even though it may seem like a friendly gesture. In Buddhist countries, touching it is insulting even for a small child because the head is regarded as sacred as the seat of soul,. Pointing your finger\: Finger pointing can be used to indicate a direction  but in Malaysia, however, people point with the whole fist and the thumb at the top indicating direction while Filipinos, on the other hand, point to an object by shifting their eyes towards it or pursing their lips and pointing to it with their mouth. Dress code\: In Muslim countries, warning\! Showing flesh — especially by women — is very offensive. Never enter a Japanese temple or home with the shoes on\: In Japan and other countries in the East, it is habitual to take off your shoes and hat. The Japanese will habitually give you a pair of slippers to take you from the front door to their living room, where they should be removed before you step on the tatami (the red mat). Be careful, always wear clean socks\! Nod your head if you mean No\: In most places nodding your head vertically up and down would indicate a "yes" and from side to side is a "no". Not in Bulgaria, where the "yes" and "no" nod are reversed.

description361=This article is from Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics , volume 9 . Abstract The prevalence of diseases caused by EV71 infection has become a serious public health problem in the Western Pacific region. Due to a lack of effective treatment options, controlling EV71 epidemics has mainly focused on the research and development (R&D) of EV71 vaccines. Thus far, five organizations have completed pre-clinical studies focused on the development of inactivated EV71 whole-virus vaccines, including vaccine strain screening, process optimization, safety and immunogenicity evaluation, and are in different stages of clinical trials. Among these organizations, three companies in Mainland China [Beijing Vigoo Biological Co., Ltd. (Vigoo), Sinovac Biotech Ltd. (Sinovac) and Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science (CAMS)] have recently completed Phase III trials for the vaccines they developed. In addition, the other two vaccines, developed by National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) of Taiwan and Inviragen Pte., Ltd (Inviragen), of Singapore, have also completed Phase I clinical trials. Published clinical trial results indicate that the inactivated EV71 vaccines have good safety and immunogenicity in the target population (infants) and confer a relatively high rate of protection against EV71 infection-related diseases. The results of clinical trials suggest a promising future for the clinical use of EV71 vaccines. Here, we review and highlight the recent progress on the R&D of inactivated EV71 whole-virus vaccines.

description349=SC Advisors has been engaged by The City of Orlando to serve as the Owner’s Advisor for the renovation of the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium. “ SC Advisors will work closely with our partners, the City of Orlando and Florida Citrus Sports , to transform this historic stadium into one of the finest bowl venues in the country,” said Jay Berlinsky, founder and owner of SC Advisors. “We look forward to the challenge.”  The project can be characterized as a re-build with the replacement of the entire lowerbowl seating structure, new premium seating areas, food service, concession facilities and overall general improvements. Construction on the $200 million project is slated to begin later this year, while pre-development and pre-construction work has been underway since October, 2012. As Owner’s Advisor, SCA will develop and manage the City’s project team that includes HNTB Corporation as the project architect, Hunt Construction Group as program manager, and Turner Construction Company as construction manager at risk. Built in 1936 with seating for 8,900 people, the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium has undergone a number of expansions and improvements. The current project is the most ambitious in the stadium's 77-year history. With more than 40 years of team experience and $2 billion in development and transactions, Orlando-based SC Advisors customizes strategies and operating plans to meet clients’ specific business and/or policy objectives and then guides them through every stage of the real estate development process.

description343=It can be rationalised that the education of high ability students is of immense importance to society, based on the principle that many of tomorrow's pioneers within the field of science will originate from this group of individuals. Consequently, these students must be equipped with critical and creative thinking skills to fulfil their intellectually demanding roles within the field of science. One way that this might be achieved is to incorporate critical and creative thinking skills into a science programme for high ability learners. This paper reports on a quantitative study that was performed to investigate teacher and student perceptions of critical and creative thinking within a science programme for high ability females at a secondary school in Singapore. Several strong correlations were identified between teachers' classroom practice and students' critical/creative thinking within the classroom. It was also discovered that students were more likely to use critical thinking skills within a science classroom compared to any other subject, but that they were more likely to use creative thinking skills while preparing for competitions such as Future Problem Solving and Odyssey of the Mind. These findings have implications for staff development within the school and the use of classroom strategies to teach critical and creative thinking. (Contains 6 tables.)

description337=Aztec Group has been in the real estate banking for three decades; but it has also done a lot in providing service in the development and construction sector, whichever type of property we are talking about\: apartments, office buildings, industrial complexes, shopping malls, self-storage and hospitality buildings. Understanding the criteria needed in the right approach to investing in these particular projects, is an expertise that Aztec has acquired through many years of experience. And so it is with having the due diligence required by their entrepreneurial and institutional clients. How does Aztec accomplish this? A company engaged in the real estate works within an environment of rapid change and innovation. Construction and infrastructure development, in general, have transformed the face of the globe, particularly in the urban areas. This is not to mention the large-scale civil work projects undertaken by institutional organizations involved in delivering essential utility needs, such as power, water supply, transportation and communication. Without keeping abreast with the innovations and future trends that these sectors undergo or will undergo, a company like Aztec will not be able to serve its clients faithfully and efficiently. The simple innovations in communication and information technology require certain adaptations in the physical design of homes and buildings that will house not just people but also the equipment and facilities that will incorporate the technology. And we have not even talked about the essential types of materials and innovative designs now available because of the need to make structures sustainable and friendly to the environment. That is why Aztec has kept its position as an innovator by seeing the opportunities on behalf of their clients even before they become apparent to both their clients and their competitors. Whereas telecommunication gadgets are rapidly changing to keep in step with the fast-changing needs of consumers and the application of newly-discovered technology, Aztec recognizes the importance of likewise finding ways to incorporate new ideas, new designs and new technology into the real estate and development industry. This is the only way it can honestly claim that it has delivered the best possible service to its clients. True, every company seeks to achieve that goal of satisfying clients' needs. However, only those which have the initiative and foresight to incorporate the subtle and unseen changes in the industry can fully comprehend the best manner in which clients will be served beyond their expectations. Service in the real estate has grown rapidly not just in volume with the corresponding population growth but also in terms of the efficiency as well as the innovativeness required by discriminating clients. With decreasing costs of materials to replace traditional materials, such as concrete, steel and lumber, which are equally or even more durable and, more importantly, easier and less costly to install and maintain, consumers and institutional users are gradually choosing to follow the trends toward innovative and economical choices. Along with these changes in the real estate and construction industry also come innovations in management, disposal, rental and maintenance of properties. Aztec makes sure that it will serve its clients by continually updating its expertise and capabilities along every significant aspect of the industry.

description335=The transformation of Singapore from a stagnating colonial port city in the late 1950s into a newly industrialized city-state in the early 1990s was the outcome of planned adjustments to changing internal and external conditions. Training and retraining programs played a role in these adjustments. Although full employment prevailed in 1979, the government was concerned about the labor displacement impact of its restructuring program. Beginning in 1980, both the Institute of Technical Education and the National Productivity Board developed a variety of adult education programs to meet the diverse education and training needs of workers. Six were of particular importance to the industrial restructuring strategy\: Basic Education for Skills Training, Worker Improvement through Secondary Education, Modular Skills Training, Core Skills for Effectiveness and Change, Training Initiative for Mature Employees, and FAST FORWARD. Their positive contributions were a shift to a more highly skilled work force, rise in average wages, full employment, and alternative employment for workers affected by structural change. Lessons from Singapore's experience include the following\: a flexible, responsive training system that facilitates skill acquisition; the development of effective institutions to guide the establishment of an employer-based training system as part of a total human resource development strategy; and Singapore's approach to problems which combines a strong belief in state action and a belief in market forces and competition.

description334=The mentoring of new principals by experienced principals is generally accepted as an important aspect of the transition to the position. Different countries may stress different aspects of mentoring and conduct training at different stages of the preparation process. In the United States and Singapore, mentoring occurs as part of the administrator-training process, and in the United Kingdom it takes place as inservice education after the new principal has achieved the position. This paper compares the differences between the models of mentoring found in the United Kingdom and Singapore. Data were derived from a questionnaire sent to a total of 76 primary and secondary principals in Singapore and to a total of 70 principals in England. All had served as mentors to new principals. The overall response rates were 61 and 71 percent, respectively. Findings indicate that principals' perceptions of the mentoring process differed substantially. The concept of coaching is appropriate to a system in which the mentor observes and grades the aspiring principal. The attachment of mentors to proteges for 8-week periods in Singapore gives the mentor the opportunity to observe growth in skills. Singapore proteges benefit from the stress on learning, while the new English principal is more likely to place a high value on the support obtained from a trusted peer. Some mentors in Singapore reported that they experienced strain from having to evaluate their proteges but described the relationship as more developmental in nature than did the English mentors. Four tables and a copy of the questionnaire are included. (Contains 13 references.) (LMI)
description333=This article is from Safety and Health at Work , volume 2 . Abstract The incidence of asbestos-related diseases (ARD) has increased in the last four decades. In view of the historical use of asbestos in Singapore since the country started banning it in phases in 1989 and the long latency of the disease, the incidence of ARD can be expected to increase further. As occupational exposure to asbestos still occurs, preventive measures to eliminate ARD continue to be required to protect the health of both workers and the public from asbestos exposure. The majority of occupational exposures to asbestos at present occur during the removal of old buildings. Preventive measures have been utilized by different government ministries and agencies in eliminating ARD in Singapore over the past 40 years. These measures have included the enforcement of legislation, substitution with safer materials, and engineering controls during asbestos removal as well as improvements in personal hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment. The existing Workman's Compensation System for ARD should be further refined, given that is currently stipulates that claims for asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma be made within 36 and 12 months after ceasing employment.

description326=This article is from British Journal of Cancer , volume 108 . Abstract Background\:\: The increasing prevalence of diabetes may contribute to the rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the US and other developed countries where HCC incidence is relatively low. Data from prospective studies on diabetes and risk of HCC in at-risk populations due to high prevalence of viral hepatitis in southeast Asia are sparse. Methods\:\: The Singapore Chinese Health Study is a prospective cohort of 63 257 middle-aged and older Chinese men and women enrolled in 1993–1998. Besides an in-person interview administered to all participants at baseline, testing of serologic markers of hepatitis B or C infections were performed on a subset of cohort subjects. After a mean follow-up of 14 years, 499 cohort participants developed HCC. Results\:\: A history of diabetes at baseline was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.69–2.71). This statistically significant association was comparable in magnitude between men and women, and remained equally strong across strata of subjects defined by the number of years between their first clinical diagnosis of diabetes and time of enrolment in this cohort. Within a nested case-control set of cohort subjects tested for serological markers of hepatitis B or C infections, the diabetes–HCC association was found to be present mainly among those devoid of any markers. Conclusion\:\: A history of diabetes at baseline is highly associated with non-viral HCC. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the biological mechanism underpinning the role of diabetes in nonviral-related hepatocarcinogenesis.
description325=Recent educational reforms in Singapore have essentially been motivated by economic and industrial concerns. Six specific training policies and practices are being implemented to respond to the perceived requirements of new work technologies\: (1) development of an increasingly flexible training system, including introduction of a dual system; (2) reorganization of the supply of vocational training by reducing the supply of training as more students go to the polytechnics and as workplace apprenticeship replaces training; provision of most training at the postsecondary level, and absorbing excess faculty; (3) retraining of older workers to increase the aggregate level of qualified workers and to avoid unemployment; (4) provision of basic skills training in the workplace; (5) creation and use of vocational training institutions that provide training in the organizational habits, culture, language, and working styles of potential multinational investors; and (6) training for new occupations through multiskilling. Rapid technological change requires more technical education--but a technical education based on a higher, not a lower or watered-down level of academic preparation. The crux of the matter is that no amount of pre-service education or training will suffice to deal with the changing needs of the workplace brought about by technological development. Signs of the merging of education and training are the expanding catalogues of continuing education courses and provision of technical services to industries by training institutions which are discovering that in order to teach they may also have to learn. Firms in Singapore have been recruiting all graduates of the education and training system, but some still invest in training. They have also discovered that organizational learning through participation of all those involved in production is a condition for survival. (Contains 10 references.) (YLB)

description323=While international and global measures are being implemented and treaty between countries is being drafted, the battle against the production, exportation, importation and distribution of counterfeit medicines still poses a challenge to regional authorities. Developing cities are the first to suffer the down side of continuous battle. With the lack of technology which can at least identify and differentiate fraudulent medicines from the real ones, it seems almost impossible to halt illegal manufacturers from their practice. Despite the smaller demographic scope, the authorities have no chance against producers who are at most times, backed up and financed by a powerful mafia. There are different issues faced by the regional sectors caused by drug counterfeiting. Above the list is corruption, bribery and other illegal complaints against the government of third world nations. There are also times when the politician himself has a direct connection with counterfeiting. In other times, the police who should be keen in implementing the law against these fraudsters are collecting money to keep their mouth shut. Also, aside from the fact that they are producing illegal medicines which are harmful to human health, they are also exploiting the citizens by forcing them to work illegally under minimum wages. The Peterson Group has once raided an illegal manufacturing operation in Jakarta, Indonesia where the workers admitted to be locally employed or referred by a friend. The work demands them of strict confidentiality. Most of them are not aware of the nature of their job but are forced to keep shut because of the need of work and income. Another regional issue is the lack of awareness among citizens within certain regions who also take medicine for disease or health maintenance. Fraudsters target individuals living in rural areas since they are not fully informed of the extent of the effects or even the existence of counterfeit medicines. Different concerned agencies acquire desperate strategies in combatting the issue. The World Health Organization (WHO) and INTERPOL have led the efforts to combat regional difficulties especially in Asia. Operation Storm was created and was a multi-country operation combating counterfeit pharmaceuticals. It brought together the Customs, Drug Regulatory Agencies and the Police of each participating country\: Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The operation seized over $12M in counterfeit medicines and more than 16 million pills, including antibiotics, anti-malarials, contraceptives, anti-tetanus vaccines, aspirin and drugs to treat erectile dysfunction.
description322=This article is from BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: With an ever-growing ageing population, dementia is fast becoming the chronic disease of the 21st century. Elderly people affected with dementia progressively lose their autonomy as they encounter problems in their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Hence, they need supervision and assistance from their family members or professional caregivers, which can often lead to underestimated psychological and financial stress for all parties. The use of Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) technologies aims to empower people with dementia and relieve the burden of their caregivers.The aim of this paper is to present the approach we have adopted to develop and deploy a system for ambient assistive living in an operating nursing home, and evaluate its performance and usability in real conditions. Based on this approach, we emphasise on the importance of deployments in real world settings as opposed to prototype testing in laboratories. Methods\: We chose to conduct this work in close partnership with end-users (dementia patients) and specialists in dementia care (professional caregivers). Our trial was conducted during a period of 14 months within three rooms in a nursing home in Singapore, and with the participation of eight dementia patients and two caregivers. A technical ambient assistive living solution, consisting of a set of sensors and devices controlled by a software platform, was deployed in the collaborating nursing home. The trial was preceded by a pre-deployment period to organise several observation sessions with dementia patients and focus group discussions with professional caregivers. A process of ground truth and system’s log data gathering was also planned prior to the trial and a system performance evaluation was realised during the deployment period with the help of caregivers. An ethical approval was obtained prior to real life deployment of our solution. Results\: Patients’ observations and discussions allowed us to gather a set of requirements that a system for elders with mild-dementia should fulfil. In fact, our deployment has exposed more concrete requirements and problems that need to be addressed, and which cannot be identified in laboratory testing. Issues that were neither forecasted during the design phase nor during the laboratory testing surfaced during deployment, thus affecting the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Results of the system performance evaluation show the evolution of system precision and uptime over the deployment phases, while data analysis demonstrates the ability to provide early detection of the degradation of patients’ conditions. A qualitative feedback was collected from caregivers and doctors and a set of lessons learned emerged from this deployment experience. (Continued on next page) (Continued from previous page) Conclusion\: Lessons learned from this study were very useful for our research work and can serve as inspiration for developers and providers of assistive living services. They confirmed the importance of real deployment to evaluate assistive solutions especially with the involvement of professional caregivers. They also asserted the need for larger deployments. Larger deployments will allow to conduct surveys on assistive solutions social and health impact, even though they are time and manpower consuming during their first phases.

description317=Across the educational systems of the world, few issues receive more attention than the problem of ensuring that elementary- and secondary-school classrooms are staffed with adequately qualified teachers. Even in nations where students routinely score high on international exams, the issue of teacher quality is the subject of concern. It is widely believed that the quality of teachers and teaching are among the most important factors shaping the learning and growth of students, an impact that goes beyond student academic achievement. Across the world, observers routinely tie the performance of teachers to numerous, larger societal goals and problems, including economic competitiveness and productivity, juvenile delinquency, and moral and civic culture. Along with a general consensus among many nations that the quality of teachers and teaching is a vital resource, there is accordingly concern surrounding how equitably this resource is distributed within educational systems. Some nations suffer from an apparent paradox\: despite an overall overproduction and oversupply of new teachers, there appear to be substantial numbers of students without access to qualified teachers. This brief summarizes the results from a collaborative, comparative study of the qualifications of elementary and secondary teachers undertaken by a group of scholars, policy makers and senior education officials from six nations and one region\: United States, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. This study revealed both commonalities and differences in the preparation and qualifications of teachers among the seven systems examined. Comparative educational research can provide a useful function by placing educational systems in context. The study suggests at least three possible sources of the problem of under-qualified teachers\: (1) Pre-employment requirements and standards; (2) Failure of the teaching force to meet existing requirements and standards; and (3) How teachers are utilized once on the job due to mis-assignment or out-of-field teaching. Focusing on upgrading the training requirements of teachers and teacher recruitment may overlook the impact of the organizational and occupational contexts within which teachers work. The data indicate that solutions to the problem of under-qualified teachers also must look to how schools are managed and how teachers are utilized once they are on the job. Recruiting thousands of new candidates and providing them with rigorous preparation will not solve the problem if large numbers of teachers receive assignments for which they are not prepared.

description314=This article is from BMJ Open , volume 4 . Abstract Introduction\: In a previous study exploring the feasibility of a smoking cessation application (app), we found that about 77% of the respondents from three countries were ready to quit in the next 30 days without significant differences between countries in terms of age, operating system and number of quitting attempts. However, the efficacy of smartphone apps for smoking cessation has not yet been established. This study tests the efficacy of a smartphone smoking cessation decision-aid app compared with an app that contains only smoking cessation information. Methods and analysis\: This is an automated double-blind, randomised controlled trial of a smoking cessation app that contains the eligibility requirements and baseline questionnaire and will randomise the participants into one of the two subapps (the intervention and the control). Participants will be recruited directly from the Apple app stores in Australia, Singapore, the UK and the USA. Daily smokers aged 18 and above will be randomised into one of the subapps after completing the baseline questionnaire. Abstinence rates will be measured at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months, with the 1-month follow-up abstinence rate as the primary outcome. Logistic regression mixed models will be used to analyse the primary outcome. Ethics and dissemination\: This study was approved by the University of Sydney's Human Ethics Committee. The results of the trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals according to the CONSORT statement. Trial registration number\: Australian New Zealand ClinicalTrial RegistryACTRN12613000833763.

description309=East Asia is the region which has experienced unprecedented growth in the past few decades. This growth resulted in the increase in education opportunities and the empowerment of women. Modernization and globalization provided opportunities for many women in China, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan. Modern Asian women can obtain higher education and gain status in their careers; they are at the crossroads between tradition and modernity. This paper provides information about the women's movements in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Readers obtain an understanding of globalization and its impact on women's lives in these societies. It concludes that the status of women has improved dramatically over the last 30 years; but there are still obstacles that prevent women from achieving equity in political participation, equal pay, and equal share of household responsibilities.

description308=Singapore is a multi-ethnic nation-state with the following ethnic groups\: Chinese (76.8%), Malay (13.9%), Indian (7.9%), and Others (1.4%) such as Eurasians, Europeans, Arabs, Jews, and Japanese. A bilingual policy, which takes English as a lingua franca and Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil as mother tongue for each ethnic group, reflects this country's multi-ethnic characteristics. The government views education as the sole intervention and the vehicle for Singaporeans to survive and to improve their social status. However, under an educational system based on meritocracy, there has been a gap among ethnic groups in academic achievement and socioeconomic status. This paper explores the following issues in Singaporean education\: (1) a system of selection of students who can attain higher education in the current system; (2) status of attainment of higher education and academic performance by ethnic groups; and (3) challenges Malay and Indian students face in their academic performance. To identify these challenges, available research on factors that affect academic attainment and performance was reviewed. The paper describes the Singapore educational system; the current educational system, by focusing on the process of student selection; the outcome of education, indicating that educational credentials relate to the prospective socioeconomic status students may achieve in Singapore; and the status of attainment to higher education and academic performance by ethnic groups. Contains 33 references. Comprehensive data tables and graphs are appended. (BT)

description306=Editor\: In 2004, Edwin Sim established Human Capital Alliance , Thailand’s  Premier Executive Search & Senior Advisory Firm. Between 1997-2003, Edwin Sim was Managing Partner of Korn Ferry Thailand.  This article was first published by the Nation in April 2003. K I Woo reviews comments made at a recent seminar by The Economist Intelligence Unit entitled “Sustainable 21st-Century Business.” Part one of a two-part series. In Thailand, as elsewhere, businessmen are under constant pressure to ensure their business is sustainable in the 21st century . They are flooded daily with high-priced business solutions developed by numerous international companies. Chavalit Tsao, the Chairman of IMC Pan Asia Alliance, a shipping company with global operations, including Thailand ’s Unithai Group, said his companies had tried almost every business solution coming down the line during his 25 years in business. ” ’In Search of Excellence’, ’Seven Habits of Effective People’ and now the ’Balanced Scorecard’ and ’Six-Sigma’ – you name it, we’ve looked at it and probably tried it,” he said. A fourth-generation shipping tycoon, Chavalit took over the family business from his father a little more than a decade ago. Recognized across the global industry, Chavalit is currently Chairman of the London-based International Association of Dry Cargo Ship-owners. At a recent seminar in Bangkok entitled “Sustainable 21st-Century Business” co-sponsored by The Economist Intelligence Unit and Korn Ferry Thailand, Chavalit acknowledged that although every successful company was compelled to try the latest management techniques, his experience still indicated that few solutions were capable of guaranteeing an organization would be sustainable throughout the 21st century. Chavalit said that during the 1990s boom, business leaders faced an almost irresolvable dilemma. “No one was just doing business\: they were only speculating. Anyone can throw a dart and hit an elephant,” he said. That period, he said, led to tremendous cultural changes in Asia . People became much more materialistic, running around with three mobile phones, buying land and speculating on shares. “Leaders had to analyze how and where they were leading their people,” he said. The social costs were tremendous. “Perception became more important than truth, legality became more important than justice, and actions that were bad suddenly became good,” he said. To resolve his dilemma, Chavalit said, he decided to look closely at cultural issues. He endowed his East West Cultural Centre and began research on 3,000 years of management history in China . “In both an Asian and a Western context, we wanted to see if we could draw something from the wisdom of the past,” he said. Chavalit said that based on his study and interpretation of Chinese culture he would respond to the question of sustainability with the following formula\: achieving sincerity, finding a holistic and interdependent dynamic balance, and the creation of harmony. “This is the process, the means and an end,” he said. Chavalit said that in his opinion, any actions that ultimately created harmony were sustainable. “Those are your key productivity-indicators,” he said. Conversely, activities that do not create harmony are not sustainable. “Business is inherently a social enterprise\: it’s about serving human needs and receiving a return or reward, which is part of the system’s design,” he said. With globalization, business has grown immensely and has a much more important role in shaping culture. Chavalit said that at the end of the day businesses, governments, and non-governmental organizations had to work together as three pillars of social development to ensure that markets and cultures were operating properly and delivering happiness to everyone. “The business sector is the most powerful and most able to mobilize and deploy resources,” he added. Modern businesses can also learn sustainability by following the ancient belief of cycles, he said. “In the ’Yijing’ ’The Book of Changes’, a classic of Chinese philosophy, everything grows, matures, dies, and then renews,” he said. At the same time, the “Yijing” emphasizes that if everybody plays his or her role, then everybody is rewarded, Chavalit said. “Heaven and earth are all-giving,” he said. As for the companies under his control, Chavalit said he wanted to develop a living organization, something that would grow and renew itself. He said that to achieve sustainability, one must be guided by principle – exercise self-restraint if the market does not itself encourage restraint. Be financially motivated – because that is how the system is structured. Be commercially oriented and technically sound. A living organization, Chavalit said, must look at more than just efficient key productivity-indicators. Company leaders must closely consider issues such as internal motivation, people orientation, process rationality, and leadership guidance. “The whole thing must be built on the concept of growth, relationship and the concept of self,” he said.
description305=Successful devolution is all down to leaders. They need the time and space to focus on what they have to do and they need the skills to enable those around them to do great work. We recently carried out research into the leadership ingredients of successful devolution agreements. Public and private collaborations need leaders who have vision and great networks. Leaders have to focus on long-term, place-based plans that address economic and societal challenges in a sustained way. This is a complex task. Leaders need the headspace to think strategically and conceptually, develop meaningful collaborations and manage change in critical services. Chief executives must be supported by their senior managers in both the public and private sectors. They in turn need to be able to plan and integrate services for the long term while engaging diverse stakeholders, from partners to politicians, staff to citizens. Some of the people we spoke to were concerned about whether senior managers could deliver this; they worried about day-to-day operations ‘falling over’. We also know that George Osborne is quite rightly concerned about UK productivity. Our research shows that leaders often fail to create productive environments. Just 18% create environments that are high performing, 13% motivating, 12% neutral and 56% demotivating. Leaders are not making the best of the skills in their teams. They tend to focus on pace, task and applying technical knowledge, rather than enabling others to give their best. We suggest three things leaders can do\: 1. Involve senior managers in shaping why devolution offers the chance to change service provision and trigger economic growth. Develop a story about why it creates better locality, and how this relates to the organisation’s mission and managers’ motivation 2. Help senior managers understand their new role in the organisation, the wider public service system and in implementing devolution. Clarify wider system accountabilities and review capacity. You may need to rethink priorities 3. Provide space for senior managers to review their approach, behaviour and development needs, to lead change in this new working context. Align development work and conversations with the needs of devolution plans , which may require setting new standards. At a recent devolution event, there was heated debate about whether the sector has the visionary leadership required to deliver the best outcomes. I’d argue that it will only exist if organisations make better use of the capacity that exists around them.
description304=Es ist nicht zu leugnen, daß es gibt Tausende von Forschungen, die von unterschiedlichen Wissenschaftlern durchgeführt oder Einzelpersonen gefunden online heute über die schlimmen Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung. Die Forscher betonen die raschen und umfangreichen Folgen dieses Phänomens. The Keeley Consulting Group hält, dass die steigende Temperatur der Oberfläche des Planeten Großkatastrophen in Zukunft bringen könnte. Eines der wichtigsten Anliegen unter Wissenschaftlern sind die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung in den Küstengebieten . Es ist offensichtlich, dass die wichtigste Faktor bedrohen die Küstengebiete der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels. Also, überrascht es nicht, dass es bestimmter Küstengemeinden weltweit häufiger Gezeiten-Überschwemmung gibt. Es wird auch erwartet, dass in den nächsten 15 bis 30 Jahren, Überschwemmungen durch Hochwasser wird öfter passieren und Störung verursachen. The Keeley Consulting Group definiert die globale Erwärmung da der allmählichen Anstieg der Durchschnittstemperatur der Erdoberfläche, vor allem seit dem vorigen Jahrhundert. Die offensichtliche Grund für den Zusammenbruch der eisbedeckten Regionen der Welt ist die Temperaturerhöhung, die trägt auch zum Anstieg des Meerwassers. Von dem Phänomen der globalen Erwärmung am schlimmsten betroffen sind die Arktis und Antarktis Eiskappen und den gigantischen Gletschern. Die Hitze schmilzt down das Gletschereis und Naturkatastrophen wie Hochwasser führt.  Die thermische Ausdehnung des Wassers kann auch einen Anstieg des Meeresspiegels als eine Nachwirkung der globalen Erwärmung verursachen. Das Wasser absorbiert Wärme und erweitert, wodurch einen Anstieg des Meeresspiegels. Die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung auslösen auch das Wasser schnell verdunstet, das zu den häufigen Wolkenbildung und erhöhte Niederschläge führt. Tiefliegende Küstengebiete werden wahrscheinlich zu unsicher geworden, da sie anfällig für Überflutungen sowie vollständige Überdeckung unter Wasser sind.  Aufgrund der globalen Erwärmung sagen viele Wissenschaftler, dass innerhalb der nächsten 50 Jahre die Oberflächentemperatur der Erde von 2ºF auf 9ºF steigen. Das Phänomen der globalen Erwärmung könnte zu verheerenden Klimaveränderungen führen. Die Kernschmelze der Eiskappen wegen der globalen Erwärmung in den polaren Regionen verfügbar die Tundra-Vegetation. Das Eis in den polaren Regionen reflektiert zurück Sonnenwärme. Das Gebiet mit der Abwesenheit von der Eisdecke umgebenden Meere aufsaugen würden die Hitze schneller und in erhöhten Betrag.

description300=This paper examines the status of parents in the developmental assessment process and considers how involving parents jointly with the professional to assess their young child may yield more accurate and valuable information. The paper explores the use of a mediated learning experience (MLE) approach as a framework for increasing support for parental involvement in the assessment process. It is suggested that changes occurring in a child's environment are potentially effective if these changes include learning experiences mediated by an adult. Criteria of mediated learning experiences are described\: intentionality and reciprocity, transcendence, meaning, feelings of competence, self-regulation, sharing behavior, individuation and psychological differentiation, goal planning, challenge, and self-change. Nine cases of children's behavior, ranging from separation anxiety to avoidance of school tasks, were discussed by 25 Singapore parents working in groups in a 3-day workshop to introduce the concepts of MLE and their relationship to behavior identification and management. One case is highlighted as an example. The paper notes that the Singapore parents identified academic tasks as major concerns in their daily mediational activities. The paper concludes by noting that the approach to assessment presented here has implications for working with parents and for training of professionals who work with them. (KB)

description291=This paper examines the influence of Japanese comic illustrations on children's books in countries in East Asia. It has become increasingly obvious that recent children's books in countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, as well as China and Malaysia/Indonesia contain illustrations with some features of the Japanese comic illustrations. This influence is primarily due to Japanese popular culture that pervades not only in comics and the media but also in fashion and pop culture especially among the young in East Asia. This study shows that although Japanese comic illustration has played a role in children's book illustrations, the influence is more obvious in commercially produced books compared to those that tell traditional folk tales, mythology, and legends. These picture books from all countries in East Asia continue to use serious artwork that is ethnically authentic. However, in mass-produced easy readers there is invariably some imitation of Japanese comic illustrations. A small survey of Singapore children shows that young readers are familiar with Japanese pop culture and show positive reading response to books with Japanese comic illustrations. Includes one chart and 21 references. An appendix contains a list of children's picture books from the People's Republic of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia, and Singapore.

description290=In accordance with the growing trend in language teaching philosophy towards assessing learner needs before choosing methods and materials, this study concentrates on the attitudes of final year bachelor degree program students towards learning and using English. These 821 students from Thailand, India, and Singapore were majoring in the fields of\: (1) English language, literature and teaching; (2) engineering; and (3) commerce/business. A closed format type of questionnaire with 111 items was used. The general conclusions drawn in the major areas studied were\: (1) although use of English was primarily for international purposes, some English was used for intranational purposes; (2) reasons for studying English and the skills preferred overwhelmingly indicated instrumental rather than integrative needs; (3) if these students are representative of other groups and countries, the future growth of English to meet the development of a world society and international market seems to be a certainty; (4) expansion of English will be further aided by decolonization and indigenization of English, as it becomes less a symbol of imperialism, and more a valid candidate for an international language and a local language for intranational purposes; and (5) English is being accepted as the country's own language with native varieties and teachers. Appendices include lists of cooperating institutions and the questionnaire with some tabulated results. (MHP)

description289=Are socio-economically disadvantaged students condemned to perpetuate an intergenerational cycle of poor academic achievement, poor job prospects and poverty? Not if they attend schools that provide them with more regular classes. Resilient students in the 2006 and 2009 PISA surveys displayed high levels of academic achievement despite the fact that they came from disadvantaged backgrounds. They beat the odds stacked against them to outperform peers from the same socio-economic background and be ranked among the top quarter of students internationally. In the Programme for International Student Assessment 2009 (PISA 2009), nearly one-third of disadvantaged students across OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries were identified as "resilient". In fact, the majority of students from disadvantaged backgrounds in Korea and the partner economies Hong Kong-China, Macao-China and Shanghai-China were considered resilient. Over 35% of disadvantaged students in Canada, Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Spain, the partner countries Liechtenstein and Singapore and the partner economy Chinese Taipei were also resilient. This issue of "PISA in Focus" suggests that schools may have an important role to play in fostering resilience. They could start by providing more opportunities for disadvantaged students to learn in class by developing activities, classroom practices and teaching methods that encourage learning and foster motivation and self-confidence among those students. High-quality mentoring programmes, for example, have been shown to be particularly beneficial. Focusing these activities on disadvantaged students is crucial, as they are the students who are least likely to receive this support elsewhere.

description287=An overview is provided of the challenges facing community colleges due to the shift from a global society shaped by political philosophies to a society shaped by economic powers. Introductory comments are followed by a description of recent changes in the world community, including the rise of Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Hong Kong as economic powers; the economic potential of newly industrialized nations like Mexico and Brazil; and the impact of the national debt on the United States economy. The next section discusses how the shift from objective/scientific to subjective/humanistic decision making affects three major job classifications as termed by Robert Reich\: "routine producers," who must have a fundamental education, be reliable and loyal, and be able to follow directions; "in-person servers," who perform repetitive tasks in a person-to-person setting, and whose work is not directly influenced by the global economy; and "symbolic-analytic servers," who trade in the manipulation of symbols and who identify and solve problems. The next section suggests that a shift from "teaching," a teacher-centered process, to "learning," a student-centered process, is required of community colleges to educate students for full employment opportunities. The final section suggests that college presidents must lead by focusing only of the ends of education, leaving the managers to concentrate on the means. (MAB)

description281=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 8 . Abstract Background\: Tuberculosis remains common in Singapore, increasing in incidence since 2008. We attempted to determine the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) isolates locally, identifying major circulating genotypes and obtaining a glimpse of transmission dynamics. Methodology\: Non-duplicate MTC isolates archived between 2006 and 2012 at the larger clinical tuberculosis laboratory in Singapore were sampled for spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing, with case data obtained from the Singapore Tuberculosis Elimination Program registry database. Isolates between 2008 and 2012 were selected because of either multidrug-resistance or potential epidemiological linkage, whereas earlier isolates were randomly selected. Separate analyses were performed for the early (2006-2007) and later (2008-2012) study phases in view of potential selection bias. Principal Findings\: A total of 1,612 MTC isolates were typed, constituting 13.1% of all culture-positive tuberculosis cases during this period. Multidrug-resistance was present in 91 (5.6%) isolates – higher than the national prevalence in view of selection bias. The majority of isolates belonged to the Beijing (45.8%) and EAI (22.8%) lineages. There were 347 (30.7%) and 133 (27.5%) cases clustered by combined spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing from the earlier and later phases respectively. Patients within these clusters tended to be of Chinese ethnicity, Singapore resident, and have isolates belonging to the Beijing lineage. A review of prior contact investigation results for all patients with clustered isolates failed to reveal epidemiological links for the majority, suggesting either unknown transmission networks or inadequate specificity of the molecular typing methods in a country with a moderate incidence of tuberculosis. Conclusion\: Our work demonstrates that Singapore has a large and heterogeneous distribution of MTC strains, and with possible cross-transmission over the past few years based on our molecular typing results. A universal MTC typing program coupled with enhanced contact investigations may be useful in further understanding the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis locally.

Aldrich, Yasuyuki Sawada and Sothea Oum)\nThis book establishes a new, holistic framework for disaster recovery and mitigation, providing a multidisciplinary perspective on the field of risk management strategies and societal and communal resilience. Going beyond narrow approaches that are all too prevalent in the field, this work builds on an optimum combination of community-level networks, private market mechanisms, and state-based assistance strategies. Its chapters describe best practices in the field and elucidate cutting-edge research on recovery, highlighting the interaction between government, industry, and civil society. The book uses new data from a number of recent disasters across southeast and east Asia to understand the interactions among residents, the state, and catastrophe, drawing on events in Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, China, and Thailand. Grounded in theories of risk mitigation and empirical research, the book provides practical guidance for decision makers along with future research directions for scholars. The Asian region is highly prone to natural disasters which devastate large and mostly poor populations. This book deals with some of the root issues underlying the continued vulnerability of these societies to catastrophic shocks. The book is unusual in that it comprehensively covers resilience and fragilities from community levels to market mechanisms and governance and it analyses these issues in very different economic and structural settings. Recommended for development and disaster risk managers—without question.

description275=This article is from Emerging Microbes & Infections , volume 3 . Abstract Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of sepsis, meningitis and respiratory disease worldwide. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have now been implemented in many countries worldwide, including Singapore. To evaluate the effectiveness of these vaccines, pneumococcal surveillance studies are required. Detailed and unified pneumococcal epidemiology data are currently scarce in South East Asia. Thus, we present data on invasive pneumococcal (IPD) isolates from Singapore that could assist in evaluating the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine in Singapore. One hundred and fifty-nine invasive pneumococcal disease isolates were received by the National Public Health Laboratory in Singapore between June 2009 and August 2010. Isolates were characterized using serotyping and multilocus sequence typing. Twenty-four different serotypes were found, the most common of which were 19A, 3, 7F, 23F, 6B, 14, 8 and 19F (in rank order). One hundred and two sequence types were observed, of which 38 were novel due to new alleles or new combinations of already existing alleles. Based on the Simpson's Index of Diversity, serotypes 3, 6B and 19A were the most genetically diverse. Novel sequence types were more prevalent among conjugate vaccine serotypes 3, 19F and 23F and non-conjugate vaccine serotype 8, serogroup 15 and in non-typable isolates. We have demonstrated considerable genetic diversity among invasive pneumococci before and during the widespread use of conjugate vaccines in Singapore. Approximately half of all novel IPD clones identified in this study were non-conjugate vaccine serotypes. Although PCVs would target the most common serotypes, the high genetic diversity in non-vaccine serotypes would require further surveillance studies.

description274=This article is from BMC Microbiology , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen that has become increasingly resistant to multiple antibiotics. Genetic manipulation of MDR A. baumannii is useful especially for defining the contribution of each active efflux mechanism in multidrug resistance. Existing methods rely on the use of an antibiotic selection marker and are not suited for multiple gene deletions. Results\: A tellurite-resistant (sacB+, xylE+) suicide vector, pMo130-TelR, was created for deleting the adeFGH and adeIJK operons in two clinical MDR A. baumannii, DB and R2 from Singapore. Using a two-step selection, plasmid insertion recombinants (first-crossover) were selected for tellurite resistance and the deletion mutants (second-crossover) were then selected for loss of sacB. The DNA deletions were verified by PCR while loss of gene expression in the ΔadeFGH, ΔadeIJK and ΔadeFGHΔadeIJK deletion mutants was confirmed using qRT-PCR. The contribution of AdeFGH and AdeIJK pumps to MDR was defined by comparing antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isogenic mutants and the parental strains. The deletion of adeIJK produced no more than eight-fold increase in susceptibility to nalidixic acid, tetracycline, minocycline, tigecycline, clindamycin, trimethoprim and chloramphenicol, while the deletion of adeL-adeFGH operon alone had no impact on antimicrobial susceptibility. Dye accumulation assays using H33342 revealed increased dye retention in all deletion mutants, except for the R2ΔadeFGH mutant, where a decrease was observed. Increased accumulation of ethidium bromide was observed in the parental strains and all pump deletion mutants in the presence of efflux inhibitors. The efflux pump deletion mutants in this study revealed that only the AdeIJK, but not the AdeFGH RND pump, contributes to antimicrobial resistance and dye accumulation in MDR A. baumannii DB and R2. Conclusions\: The marker-less gene deletion method using pMo130-TelR is applicable for creating single and multiple gene deletions in MDR A. baumannii. The adeFGH and adeIJK operons were successfully deleted separately and together using this method and the impact of each efflux pump on antimicrobial resistance could be defined clearly.

description272=In many things, when we see the price is high, we immediately assume that it is top notch in quality. Yet, experts strongly advise that we should not be blinded by the price tag alone since it is usually not an indication on the longevity or the robustness of the certain material, well, at least when we are shopping for our upholstery fabrics. The price may signify other things such as the intricacies of designs, the sophistication of the pattern, high aesthetic value or the particularly refinement or lustre.   To identify the worth and the quality of the fabric of your upholstery furnishing, the Peterson Group , one of the leading suppliers of high quality fabrics introduces the most common upholstery and its characteristics\: 1.     Velour   Velour is a combination of all fabrics for which yarns is woven into basic material.  With a certain process, the yarn is turned into a wear resistant fiber. This type is basically the experts’ favorite since it promises long sustenance. Very rarely can you see fraud copies of this kind of fabric as it is intricately woven and cannot be easily done by just anyone. Also, velours are easily identifiable. When it is impacted by pressure and body, it slightly changes, thus the change in lustre which is also commonly its complaint.   2.     Flat Woven Fabric According to Polster Services\: A review of upholstery, Flat woven fabric is a term used for fabric types constructed from two sets of threads crossed at right angles. Normal seating alone can result in “pillings” developing on the fabric‘s surface. In technical terminology this is called pilling formation. For flat woven fabric, printed colors may easily lighten its color intensity with the exposure to light or in simple terms, the fabric can easily fade. For this reason, it should not be exposed to too much sunlight. 3.     Flat Woven Fabric According to Polster Services\: A review of upholstery, Flat woven fabric is a term used for fabric types constructed from two sets of threads crossed at right angles.

description269=Many high school and college students experience serious difficulties in understanding as well as applying fundamental concepts in physics. The study reported in this paper focused on the difficulties in learning about vectors in physics and strategies for making the teaching of vectors more interesting and meaningful for students. Specifically, the study aimed at\: developing instructional materials for linking the notion of vectors, especially composition of vectors and resolution of a vector, with the real Physics world; planning appropriate demonstrations in conjunction with the Prediction-Demonstration-Explanation (PDE) teaching method to highlight the meaningful applications of the notion of vectors in daily phenomena as well as to make the learning of vector concepts and rules more interesting for students; and exploring the effectiveness of the use of the PDE method in helping students grasp the notion of vectors. The sample consisted of 94 junior college students divided into an experimental and a control group who took pre- and post-tests. The results indicate that students in the experimental group, who were taught by the Prediction-Demonstration-Explanation method, showed a better improvement in performance on the tests than students in the control group.

description268=The present study concerns the way in which its participants have picked up and cognitively integrated information on various models of possible societal development. The study draws attention to a perceiverâs potential of co-ordinating his views of the consequences of behaviour with behavioural control. Accordingly, the participants have been asked to prospect the consequences possible in a given environment and report their judgements in two different ways. One concerns the measurement of Eigenvalue. Consequently, it may be expected that attitudes and beliefs about one-self are introducing more about cultural and economic differences than is suggested by projected cultural values and socialisation practices. The other concerns a filter effect that might be expected to work on the societal endowment of behavioural tendencies and integrate possible differentiation and separation by means of cultural layers, which constitute its shape becoming visible in the form of social texture. Both factors relate the participantâs perceptual sensitivity and adequate judgement to novel sequences of events. In confronting different students with different types of civilisation in different environments it has been possible to demonstrate that competitiveness is the major source of variation in the development of Eigenvalue.

description266=Malay's long use as the dominant linga franca throughout modern Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore is partly responsible for its current status as the national language of all three countries. However, political and economic developments during and since the colonial era have created sociolinguistic contexts, motives, and results of the language's status that are very different for each country. In Indonesia, the policies of the Indonesian nationalists, Dutch, and Japanese converged to promote Bahasa Indonesia successfully as an ethnically neutral symbol of identity and integration. In Malaysia, the selection and promotion of Bahasa Malaysia as the national language was motivated partly by ethnic communalism rather than national unity, but it was also enhanced by British and Japanese policy. In Singapore, Malay serves to express international integration and unity with her two closest neighbors and is a factor in the balance of ethnic sentiments. The status and domains of Malay in the three countries are constantly changing and evolving, reflecting the complexities of the national language question in this area.

description263=This article is from BMC Public Health , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: Prehypertension has been shown to be an early risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated the prevalence and pattern of cardiometabolic risk factors in prehypertension in three ethnic Asian populations in Singapore. Methods\: We examined data from Chinese (n \= 1177), Malay (n \= 774), and Indian (n \= 985) adults aged 40–80 years who participated in three independent population based studies conducted from 2004–2011 in Singapore who were free of diabetes, hypertension and previous CVD. Prehypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) 120–139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80–89 mm Hg. Random blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were examined as indicators of adverse cardiometabolic profile. The association between metabolic variables and prehypertension was examined using logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders. Results\: The prevalence of prehypertension was 59.8% (Chinese), 68.9% (Malays) and 57.7% Indians. Higher levels of blood glucose, HbA1c and BMI were significantly associated with prehypertension in all three ethnic groups, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of prehypertension in Chinese, Malays and Indians were\: 1.42 (1.10, 1.83), 1.53 (1.05, 2.24), 1.49 (1.13, 1.98) for high-glucose; 3.50 (1.01, 12.18), 3.72 (1.29, 10.75), 2.79 (1.31, 5.94) for high-HbA1c; 1.86 (1.34, 2.56), 2.96 (2.10, 4.18), 1.68 (1.28, 2.20) for high-BMI. In addition, higher levels of LDL cholesterol in Chinese and higher levels of triglycerides were significantly associated with prehypertension. These associations persisted when metabolic variables were analysed as continuous variables. Conclusions\: Higher levels of blood glucose, HbA1c and BMI were associated with prehypertension in all three ethnic groups in Singapore. Screening for prehypertension and lifestyle modifications could potentially reduce the burden of CVD in otherwise healthy Asian adults living in Singapore.

description260=In this article, research assessment in Singapore's higher education sector is viewed as part of the broader trend towards changing educational accountabilities in a context of globalisation. However, while on the one hand, recent Singaporean policies resonate with a neo-liberal market ideology where accountability policies are designed to enhance international competitiveness, on the other hand Singapore's policies also reflect its own unique context. That is, Singapore's policies and practices in relation to accountability in general, and research assessment in particular, are embedded in its own historical, economic, social and cultural traditions. There is a "price to pay", however, for competing with the West, especially in terms of preserving relevant research for local community development. "Global"-"local" tensions are clearly manifest as Singapore increasingly turns towards America as a model in its drive to enhance research productivity.

description259=The 21st century promises to make very different demands on our children and schools in a knowledge-based society. A slow but dynamic shift has been occurring in the Singapore educational system toward a learning nation and thinking school ethos. In the midst of this change, children will need to acquire a new set of skills. They will need to be able to use a variety of tools to search and sort vast amounts of information, generate new data, analyze them, interpret their meaning, and transform them into something new. Change of this magnitude demands that learning no longer be encapsulated by time, place, and age but become a pervasive activity and attitude that continues throughout life. The main objectives of this paper are to examine the relationships among cognitive modifiability, mediated learning experience, and affective-motivational factors, and to suggest a transactional approach toward learning and instruction to face the challenging demands confronting our children and schools. Some prominent nonintellectual dimensions related to mediation and cognitive processes are described, and examples are depicted that demonstrate various interactive relationships among motivational-affective factors, cognitive processes, and mediated learning experience. Important implications for clinical and educational intervention and for research in our knowledge-based society are also outlined. (Contains 15 references.) (Author/KB)

description247=This article is from Indian Journal of Palliative Care , volume 18 . Abstract Background\:\: “Do not resuscitate” (DNR) orders are put in place where cardiopulmonary resuscitation is inappropriate. However, it is unclear who should be involved in discussions and decisions around DNR orders. Aim\:\: The aim was to determine the views of oncology and palliative care doctors and nurses on DNR orders. Materials and Methods\:\: A questionnaire survey was conducted on 146 doctors and nurses in oncology and palliative care working within a tertiary specialist cancer center in Singapore. Results\:\: Perceived care differences as a result of DNR determinations led to 50.7% of respondents reporting concerns that a DNR order would mean that the patient received a substandard level of care. On the matter of DNR discussions, majority thought that patients (78.8%) and the next of kin (78.1%) should be involved though with whom the ultimate decision lay differed. There was also a wide range of views on the most appropriate time to have a DNR discussion. Conclusions\:\: From the viewpoint of oncology and palliative care healthcare professionals, patients should be involved at least in discussing if not in the determination of DNR orders, challenging the norm of familial determination in the Asian context. The varied responses highlight the complexity of decision making on issues relating to the end of life. Thus, it is important to take into account the innumerable bio-psychosocial, practical, and ethical factors that are involved within such deliberations.

description245=This study examines the relationship between computer self-efficacy and intended uses of technology of student teachers (N\=1094) at a teacher training institute in Singapore. Self-efficacy was assessed by three factors\: Basic Teaching Skills (BTS), Advanced Teaching Skills (ATS), and Technology for Pedagogy (TP), and intended use of technology was measured by two factors\: Traditional Use of Technology (TUT) and Constructivist Use of Technology (CUT). Participants responded to a 7-point Likert-type scale for each factor. Analysis was conducted using the structural equation modelling approach and a good model fit was found for both the measurement and structural models. Results showed that significant relationships exist among BTS, TP, TUT, and CUT. However, ATS did not influence TUT and CUT in a significant way. Overall, the results of this study offer some evidence that student teachers' self-efficacy is a significant influence on whether they use technology in a traditionalist or constructivist way.

description244=Background\: Singapore is experiencing great demographic change. These demographic trends show fewer young people and declining birth rates, greater longevity for ageing generations and an increase in the number of non-Singaporean residents. Statistics also show that more than half of the total population increase in the last decades was contributed by non-resident (non-Singaporeans). These demographic trends have far-reaching implications for schools and educators. Aims\: The paper looks at how key demographic trends will reshape Singapore's schools. The paper focuses on three key factors-mortality, fertility and migration-and their impact on schools. Method\: The analyses are based on existing demographic data and trends. The data is taken from Singapore Department of Statistics, 2008. Results\: The first two factors, namely ageing population and declining birth rates, lead to the need to develop lifelong learning skills. The third factor of immigration leads towards multiculturalism in education for hybrid identities to work, think, and play across cultural boundaries. Conclusion\: It is necessary to ensure that the school structures are responsive to changing needs, so that it can evolve in a timely manner to prepare the learners meaningfully. Schools in Singapore have to incorporate a wider range of activities that can help to develop 21st century skills without compromising the rigor and quality of the original school and curriculum structure which has served the needs of the students in Singapore well.

description243=The present situation and future trends of programed learning in Ceylon, Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Republic of Viet-Nam are described by the Workshop participants. Some of the unique features of programed learning are examined with respect to the specific needs of the developing nations of Asia. Data obtained from a questionnaire circulated at the workshop is summarized giving the participants' views concerning the general problems of utilizing programed instruction in their respective countries. Suggestions are offered to assist the Asian nations in introducing programed instruction, training producers and users, identifying priority subject areas, developing needed hardware and software, producing programed materials, conducting research, and disseminating information. The role of national governments and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in fostering the cause of programed instruction is discussed. Plans for the future include establishing a consulting committee for UNESCO, grouping interested countries for cooperative programs, and offering training courses. (JY)
description242=Job training is a powerful tool for growth, but only if embedded in a climate of pro-growth policies that it complements. To attract capital to create growth and jobs, a country has to offer favorable supply side conditions. A skilled labor force is one of several important supply side categories, whose growth effects are strongest when the other supply side conditions are favorable as well. Four reasons for paying special attention to human capital are as follows\: trying to be as good as the best; higher wages justified by higher productivity; capital-intensive, labor-saving, technology-intensive production processes that require highly skilled labor; and an educational continuum for those willing to work for lower wages and the academically trained high achievers and everyone in between. German vocational training is a mass apprenticeship system run by the private sector within a public-private partnership. Trainees in all sectors of the economy usually begin training right after leaving school. Youth training is the best unemployment insurance and the best weapon against youth unemployment. It works best when it is work-based, performance-oriented, structured learning. The vocational system must not foreclose the option of apprentices to go to college. Germany is currently building a new system that combines academic and practical training and fills the gap between traditional vocational training and the university--the Berufsakademie (professional academy). A variant is already practiced in Singapore. (Eleven tables are appended.) (YLB)
description241=This monograph presents nine author-contributed papers which look at issues of aging and mental retardation from the perspectives of nine nations\: Australia (by Trevor R. Parmenter), Great Britain (by Steve Moss), Canada (by Gerrit Groeneweg), Germany (by Gottfried Adam), Hong Kong (by John W. L. Tse), Indonesia (by D. Lianta), Japan (by Takeo Kanetsuki), the Netherlands (by Meindert J. Haveman and Marian A. Maaskant), and Singapore (by M. K. Wong). A concluding paper by the editor notes three predominating philosophies of service welfare\: the Asian model (with its emphasis on family care through the extended family); the Western European model (with institutional care a major component); and the North American/United Kingdom model (characterized by a strong philosophy of normalization and deinstitutionalization). Other conclusions suggest that most countries have adopted a largely voluntary sector organization supported from government finance and that all these countries recognize the urgency of developing policies and services for the increasing numbers of older persons with developmental disabilities. An American perspective on the issues is provided in commentaries by seven American authors. Most papers include references. (DB)

But in East Asia a new system has emerged that challenges the economic principles the West extols. In fact, as James Fallows vividly demonstrates, the theories we embrace to explain how nations rise and fall have prevented us from seeing the true nature of this new system and its enormous impact on us." "Skillfully blending history with on-the-ground reportage and astute analysis, Fallows reveals how political goals and historical experience have shaped Japan's economic rise and placed it at the heart of the Asian system. He shows how the explosive growth of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore has been fueled by Japanese investment; why Burma, the Philippines, and Vietnam have been largely isolated from the region's progress; and why Korea, Taiwan, and "Greater China" are the strongest contenders for future economic dominance." "Extraordinary in depth and scope, Looking At the Sun provides the first clear picture of the Asian rise and the magnitude of its challenge to the Western world."--Jacket\n

description237=This article is from Journal of Veterinary Science , volume 14 . Abstract Swine hepatitis E virus (HEV) is widespread throughout pigs in both developing and industrialized countries. This virus is an important zoonotic agent and a public concern worldwide. Infected pigs are asymptomatic, so diagnosing swine HEV relies on detection of the virus or antibodies against the virus. However, several obstacles need to be overcome for effective and practical serological diagnosis. In this study, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that used a purified recombinant capsid protein of swine HEV. The potential clinical use of this assay was evaluated by comparing it with a commercial kit (Genelabs Technologies, Diagnostics, Singapore). Results of the ELISA were highly correlated with those of the commercial kit with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 95%. ROC (receiving operator characteristic) analysis of the ELISA data produced a value of 0.987 (95% CI, 0.977~0.998, p < 0.01). The cut-off value for the ELISA was also determined using negative pig sera. In summary, the HEV-specific ELISA developed in the present study appears to be both practical and economical.
description236=This article is from Indian Journal of Ophthalmology , volume 61 . Abstract Objective\:\: To evaluate the factors influencing final vision outcome after surgical repair of open globe injuries and to correlate the Ocular trauma score. Materials and Methods\:\: Retrospective case analysis of patients with open globe injuries at a tertiary referral eye care centre in Singapore was performed. Pre-operative factors affecting final vision outcome in patients with open globe injury and correlation of ocular trauma score in our study with international ocular trauma scoring system was performed. Results\:\: Case records of 172 eyes with open globe injury were analyzed. Mean age was 36. 67 years. Mean follow up was 12.26 m. Males were pre-dominantly affected. Initial visual acuity was ≥20/40, 20/50 < 20/200, 20/200- CF, HM– PL and NLP in 24 (14%), 39 (22.7%), 16 (9.3%), 66 (38.4%) and 27 (15.7%) eyes respectively. Final visual acuity was ≤20/40, 20/50 < 20/200, 20/200- 1/200, HM– PL and NLP in 76 (44.2%), 28 (16.3%), 11 (6.4%), 30 (17.4%) and 27 (15.7%) eyes respectively. Ocular trauma score in our study correlates with international ocular trauma scoring system. Conclusion\:\: The present study showed pre-operative variables such as mode of injury, pre-operative visual acuity, traumatic cataract, hyphaema, relative afferent papillary defect, vitreous lossand vitreous hemorrhage to be adversely affecting the final vision outcome. Our study showed a good synchrony with international ocular trauma score (OTS) and based on this study we were able to validate application of OTS in Singapore population. Recognizing these factors can help the surgeon in evidence based counseling.

description222=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract High prevalence of infection with high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) ranging from 25 to 100% (average 31%) was observed in breast cancer (BC) patients in Singapore using novel DNA chip technology. Early stage of BC demonstrated higher HPV positivity, and BC positive for estrogen receptor (ER) showed significantly higher HPV infection rate. This unique association of HPV with BC in vivo prompted us to investigate a possible involvement of HPV in early stages of breast carcinogenesis. Using normal breast epithelial cells stably transfected with HPV-18, we showed apparent upregulation of mRNA for the cytidine deaminase, APOBEC3B (A3B) which is reported to be a source of mutations in BC. HPV-induced A3B overexpression caused significant γH2AX focus formation, and DNA breaks which were cancelled by shRNA to HPV18 E6, E7 and A3B. These results strongly suggest an active involvement of HPV in the early stage of BC carcinogenesis via A3B induction.

Countries studied include Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

The availability of heroin, opium, and cannabis in this part of the world is described and the seriousness of the drug problem in Malaysia is discussed. Data tables illustrate the number of drug abusers in the country and specific characteristics of abusers. The role of public education with respect to drug abuse prevention is described and activities of the governmental ministries are listed. Malaysia's comprehensive rehabilitation and treatment programs are presented and programs offered by prisons, governmental rehabilitation centers, and private agencies are described. Aftercare, required of all drug abusers, is discussed. A summary of drug abuse and treatment in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines is appended. (NB)

description199=This paper provides a personal look at counseling and counselor education in Hong Kong and Singapore. A section on the availability of formal and informal training resources in counseling notes that many practitioners in the counseling profession in Hong Kong or Singapore go abroad to pursue graduate studies, since, comparatively speaking, Hong Kong and Singapore can offer no better option for graduate training in counseling than what can be obtained abroad. Opportunities for professional development in Hong Kong and Singapore do exist, however, and they include counseling courses offered by the Institute of Education and the National University of Singapore through the Department of Social Work and Psychology; the services of a variety of counseling experts obtained by the counseling associations in Singapore and Hong Kong; and the presence of a professional association, the Association of Psychological and Educational Counselors of Asia. A section on the emerging job identity of counselors looks at distinctions among counselors, social workers, and psychologists and at the attitudes of the federal government toward counselors and counseling. A section on problems presented to counselors identifies the areas of behavioral and emotional problems of children and youth, parent-child relationships, and marital problems in Hong Kong; and relationship problems, psychological problems, physical problems, material problems, and sexual problems in Singapore. The paper concludes with a summary of problems in counseling in Hong Kong and Singapore. (NB)

description198=In the study reported here, the authors examined the LEs (learning expectations) related to Grades 1 to 8 number and quantity in mathematics across several US states and high performing TIMSS (Third International Mathematics and Science Study) Asian countries, including Singapore, Taiwan and Japan. The general strategy used is based on the topic tracing method. Several approaches and lenses have been used to analyze the LEs in each document. In order to simplify the procedures, only one topic within the number and quantity strand is reported here. Results of this study indicated that the mathematics contents, grade placement and cognitive level of LEs related to selected topic vary markedly across documents. Thus, these differences may have impact on students' opportunities to learn. (Contains 9 tables and 2 figures.)

description191=According to the news from The Economist, entitled “Economic Convergence\: Economic Headwinds Return”, “Ten years ago, developing economies were catching up with developed ones remarkably quickly. It was an aberration.” Reviewing the decade-and-a-half journey of China from a lagging economy to one that has surpassed many nations in Europe in terms of average income generation, the article describes the dire realities that beset the once sleeping-giant-turned-global-power. Using Hong Kong as the standard by which to measure economic growth , average incomes dip to 50% in Shenzhen, to 25% in Guandong and to a mere 10% in Yunnan. That is an overall average of less than 30% that of Hong Kong, which is essentially a small dot of an island compared to the gigantic mainland China teeming with so many millions of people. The average annual rate of growth from 2000 to 2009 for developing nations was 7.6%, 4.5% higher than that seen in developed rich nations . That unprecedented rate practically narrowed down the gap between the developed and developing countries. The once deprived populations of the world, a big majority of whom are found in Asia and living on less than the global poverty level of $1.25 daily income, surged on from a share of 30% of the world population in 2000 to less than 10% as of April 2014, according to the Center for Global Development based on new date from the World Bank. At that pace, it is estimated that in only 30 years, the average income per person would converge with that in America. This is certainly cause for great hope for many people on a global scale. Sad to say, those hopes are now slipping away. An evaluation of data on GDP per person based on new computations of cost of living released in April by the World Bank’s International Comparison Programme (ICP) seems to show that convergence has slowed down drastically. Since 2008, growth rates across the emerging nations have slowed down and matched those in developed economies. When the new ICP figures are applied, the average GDP per capita in the emerging world, measured on a purchasing-power-parity (PPP) basis, grew just 2.6 percentage points faster than American GDP in 2013. If China is removed from the estimates, the difference is only 1.1%. At that rate, convergence with rich-economy incomes will occur in a hundred years or more, longer than a generation. If China is included, emerging economies could expect to reach rich-world income levels, on average, in a little over half-a-century. Japan, which achieved industrialization in the first part of the 20th century, grew to be the world’s second largest economy, next to USA. South Korea, Taiwan and several city-states like Singapore and Hong Kong also grew and developed into prosperous nations. The rush to achieve levels of growth close to those of developing nations became an addiction to these nations and others who needed to catch up as well. The price paid in terms of investments on human capital led to social and political problems as some nations had to export their workers to the industrialized or more prosperous nations. Ironically, the income generated by those workers help to sustain those nations during the crises that transpired. In trying to explain the growth disparity, economists pointed to institutions being the key while others focused on “geography and climate”. Moreover, they said that “remoteness from economic centers and hot, disease-prone conditions could retard development,” which is the case in many of the Southeast Asian countries where the issues of rebellion and ethnic differences provide obstacles to development of the depressed country-sides.

description184=Noting that play varies as a function of culture, gender, setting, and parent or teacher valuing, a study examined the play of children in Singapore. Subjects were 56 middle- and working-class preschoolers between the ages of 46 and 72 months who were videotaped at play in their homes and in the child care centers that they attended and rated on the Parten/Piaget and Smilansky play scales. The children's mothers completed a 20-item questionnaire on their attitude towards play and were assessed as to socioeconomic status by the Hollingshead 4-factor index. It was found that parallel play and functional play occurred more at home, whereas associative and cooperative play occurred more in the child care centers. Girls' play scores were higher than boys on the Smilansky but not the Parten/Piaget play scales. The lack of socioeconomic status differences and the relative mildness of sex differences reflects a strong movement toward modernity in Singapore families. (MDM)

description179=How can I mitigate the risk of a concentrated holding? Diversifying your stock may be the right thing to do, but it can be difficult to give up the position that represents the source of your family’s success. Families hold onto their stock for other reasons too\: to protect against capital gains taxes or retain a control position in their company. Every situation is different. But you have to consider both the personal and financial ramifications of holding a concentrated position. Our Research Report, Concentrated Stock Portfolios, indicates that single stocks are, on average, 40% more volatile than a diversified portfolio. In fact, 92% of the S&P 500 constituents experienced a higher volatility than the S&P 500 Index itself in the annualized ten-year period ending June 30, 2013, according to the report. And while the equity market eventually recovers from adversity, not all individual companies do. What does this mean for you? That depends on many things. What is your risk tolerance? Is it better to pay capital gains taxes today? What will the trade-off be of remaining concentrated? Which strategy will help you sleep comfortably? We’ve worked with private families for more than thirty years. Our specialty is figuring out the best options for your family now and for future generations.

description174=Associations between the nature of Chinese Language Classroom Environments and Singapore secondary school students' motivation to learn the Chinese Language were investigated. A sample of 1,460 secondary three (grade 9) students from 50 express stream (above average academic ability) classes in Singapore government secondary schools was involved in the study. The perceptual measure approach was used to investigate the nature of Chinese Language classroom learning environment. A well-validated classroom environment instrument, the "Chinese Language Classroom Environment Inventory (CLCEI)" (Chua, Wong, & Chen, 2006; Chua, 2004) was used to investigate teachers' and students' perceptions towards their Chinese Language classroom learning environments in six dimensions, namely "Student Cohesiveness", "Teacher Support", "Involvement", "Cooperation", "Task Orientation" and "Equity". Students' motivation to learn the Chinese Language was examined using the "Chinese Language Motivation Scale" (CLMOTS) (Soh, 1993). Two statistical procedures, simple correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis, were used to examine the relationships between students' motivation to learn the Chinese Language and the nature of their Chinese Language classroom learning environments. The results from the simple correlational analysis indicated that students' motivation to learn Chinese Language was found positively correlated with all the six learning environment dimensions under investigation. However, the results from the multiple regression analysis indicated that students' motivation to learn Chinese Language were associated with only three dimensions of the learning environments, "Teacher Support", "Involvement" and "Task Orientation", where the "Task Orientation" dimension having the most significant association with students' motivation to learn Chinese Language. The findings are consistent with many previous studies on motivation that academically motivated students are usually those students who are task-orientated (Gardner, 2001; Stipek, 1993).

description172=Many studies support the existence of a significant decline in students' academic self-concept from early to mid-adolescence. In comparison, the findings on gender effect are less conclusive. This study aimed to determine whether there is any grade or gender effect on adolescents' academic self-concept in the Singapore context. Specifically, the cross-sectional study was conducted with Secondary 1, 2 and 3 students (N \= 656) in a government co-educational school. The results established a significant main effect according to grade, with Secondary 3 students having significantly lower academic self-concept (scale and subscales) than Secondary 1 and 2 students. In addition, there was a significant main effect for gender, with female students having significantly higher perceived academic effort (academic self-concept subscale) than their male counterparts.

description159=Over the past two decades, researchers and language specialists have addressed the problem of a lack of resources in developing nations for teaching English as a Second Language by using the Book Flood approach, which "floods" classroom with high-interest illustrated story books. Components of such programs include language experience, shared reading, story reading aloud, independent reading, paired reading, and guided silent reading and writing. The Book Flood strategy draws on many of the components of a child-centered approach to literacy teaching, developed over many years by New Zealand teachers. A Book Flood program was established in eight rural schools in Fiji in the early 1980s. Pupils experienced an "unusually rapid" rate of English language growth. Lack of funds prevented continuation of the project. In 1985, the Singapore Ministry of Education embarked on a similar Book Flood project called REAP (Reading and English Acquisition Program). Results were similarly positive, and became part of the regular primary education curriculum by 1990. The most recent large-scale Book Flood project that has been systematically evaluated is located in Sri Lanka. The pilot project has confirmed, in only 5 months, what the earlier studies took much longer to demonstrate\: that an abundant supply of high-interest illustrated story books can have a strong impact on children's language growth, provided that teachers ensure that the children interact with books daily and productively. Over the past 16 years, READ Education Trust, an independent organization based in Johannesburg, South Africa, has been working to improve reading levels in Black schools throughout South Africa using methods similar to those described above. The program has been widely rated by teachers and is highly successful in making pupils more fluent readers and confident users of English. (Contains 11 references and 7 figures of data.) (RS)

description155=This ERIC Digest discusses how, by studying Japan, the larger context of the Asia-Pacific region can be explored and students can be introduced to current realities. The top 5 competitive countries for 1994 were the United States, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, and Germany. Because of the increasing interdependence between the United States and Japan, and Japan's place as an important part of Asia-Pacific dynamism, it is imperative that U.S. students increase their knowledge and understanding of Japan. The study of Japan has important multicultural dimensions. Mutual understanding continues to be illusive because attempts to examine aspects of Japanese culture sometimes result in exchanging one stereotype for another. What is needed is an exploration of the historical, economic, geographic, and sociological reasons behind what seems to be a propensity for group orientation. Suggested strategies for teaching about Japan while ensuring cultural accuracy include\: (1) utilizing multiple perspectives; (2) including historical context; (3) involving Japanese nationals and other community resource persons; (4) exploring the underlying values of the culture; (5) considering introducing the Japanese language; and (6) introducing contemporary topics. Two resources for teaching about Japan are discussed\: (1) the National Clearinghouse for U.S.-Japan Studies; and (2) the Center for Educational Media (CEM). Also included is information on obtaining resources from the ERIC system. Contains a 9-item reference list. (DK)

description146=Metacognition is considered by most educationists to be an element necessary for many cognitive learning tasks. In general, within problem solving tasks, procedural, factual, and conceptual knowledge, by themselves, are insufficient for successful task completion. To be successful, the problem solver must usually demonstrate higher level cognitive skills, i.e., metacognitive strategies, including the planning, the monitoring, the controlling, the selecting, and the evaluating of intellectual activities. This study of students' metacognitive strategies was conducted in Singapore with more than 670 secondary and pre-university students from 13 schools over a 2-year period. A 20 item questionnaire for self-reporting about metacognitive beliefs, about the use of metacognitive strategies during mental tasks involving memory, comprehension, and problem solving techniques, and about attitudes towards the learning of specific academic subjects was administered to 8th, 10th, and 11th grade students. These students were enrolled across three distinct academic courses of study (general, science, and the arts) with each domain being subdivided into three different academic streams or tracks (special, normal and express), that are described in detail. No significant differences were found in the frequency of use of metacognitive strategies among the students from the different courses of study, yet within each of these courses of study, the normal track students exhibited less frequent usage of metacognitive strategies than those students within the express and special tracks.

description145=This study was conducted in order to examine the process of teacher development in a close interplay between educational principles and classrooms in a Singapore practicum curriculum. The process of teacher development is regarded as a continuous, self-renewing, lifelong process. Since no comprehensive constructivist model of teacher development has been advanced in the literature to guide in the design of teacher education programs, this paper seeks to spell out the rationale and relationship of the four basic components of a teacher development program with respect to\: (1) subject matter; (2) teaching methods; (3) educational principles; and (4) classroom practice. Humanistic constructivism provides the underlying philosophy and pedagogy of the proposed teacher development model. Through a better articulation of teacher roles, internalization of educational principles, and reflection of classroom practices, teachers' professional development grows. Based on this model of teacher development in a practicum curriculum, some research evidence of professional growth is presented using student teachers' self-appraisal of their own and their cooperating teachers' classroom practice.

description144=The major explanatory interests of 17 studies summarized and individually abstracted in this report are\: 1) the relationships between characteristics and conditions of educational systems and processes; and, 2) the pattern and trends in the formation of political and politically relevant attitudes among children and adolescents exposed to such systems and processes. During this part of a 5-year research program which began in 1966 3 studies were set in the U.S., 6 in Africa, and 1 each in Colombia, Micronesia, Venezuela, New Guinea, Malasia, Singapore, Chile, and West Germany. A description of each study's purpose, setting, methodology, and major findings is provided in the 2-4 page abstracts in Chapter 2. An overview of the project's problem areas, its relationship to the growing field of political socialization, and specific project objectives are given in Chapter 1. Chapter 3 includes a discussion of selected empirical findings, recommendations for further research, and methodological notes. Significant factors in attitude development were found to be outside of the formal curriculum\: in the general societal context and the organizational and cultural configurations within school settings. Two books by the author, substantially based on the project findings, will be published in 1972. (Author/DJB)

description139=Reflective teaching has been one of the three main goals of the preservice teacher education programs in the National Institute of Education, Singapore, since the late 1980s. A three-phase study, of which the first two phases are described, is examining how Singapore student teachers think about teaching in the preservice programs, how they identify the constraints they have about teaching, how they identify learning problems, and what happens to their teaching behaviors as they move through the programs into teaching practice and into the first year of teaching. In Phase One, 78 preservice student teachers from undergraduate and graduate programs viewed a videotape of a classroom lesson on road safety and were asked to critique the lesson; the critiques were then rated on their level of reflective thinking. In Phase Two, 18 undergraduate and graduate students described in journal writing their reflections on 5 classroom episodes, and their level of reflective writing was evaluated. Results indicated that the level of reflective thinking for both undergraduate and graduate level student teachers began at a low level, but those with more subject matter knowledge and skills or working experience (graduate level students) improved at a faster rate. Implications of the study and recommendations are discussed. Appendixes contain a lesson evaluation form and weekly journal writing guidelines. (Contains 29 references.) (JDD)

The introductory chapter describes the research on which the guide is based, discusses common themes affecting the quality of training in the countries studied, and examines the rationale for training programs. Chapter 2 summarizes the subsequent discussion of the effectiveness of national training boards in the form of a checklist and guidelines for use by countries considering establishing a national training board. Chapters 3-9 synthesize research findings into practical recommendations dealing with the following aspects of initiating and operating national training boards\: enabling legislation, training board composition, training board structure, financial resources, delivery of training, institutional planning and operations, and testing and certification. Chapters 10 and 11, which are more analytical than the chapters preceding them, examine the perception and images of national training boards and lessons learned from the case studies.

description137=In 1983, the Institute of Education in Singapore started a nine-year longitudinal project funded by the Bernard van Leer Foundation in Holland to study the cognitive and social development of pre-school children in Singapore. Each phase of the project was to last 3 years. Phase One (July 1983 through June 1986) concentrated on the collection of baseline data from which possible subsequent intervention strategies would be recommended. Phase Two (July 1986 through June 1989) focuses on center-based intervention strategies. Phase Three (July 1989 through June 1992) proposes to work on the involvement of parents in center activities. Between 1983 and 1986, four data collections were carried out on a sample of pupils aged 3.5 to 6 years from 40 local preschool centers. The chosen subjects were tested on a range of language, mathematics, cognitive and social tasks. Children attending private kindergartens were generally found to score better on most tasks, especially on the English Language Tasks. On most cognitive and mathematical tasks, the gap narrowed for the older students, although this change was not demonstrated on the English Language Tasks. The results suggest that there is a strong case for intervention in English at the pre-school level for Phase Two. (RJC)

The project aimed to improve the percentage of on-time start iMRI neurosurgeries to 100% within nine months. Materials and Methods\:\: Clinical Practice Improvement methodology was used. The project involves four phases\: Diagnostic, in which a baseline analysis is conducted; Intervention, in which problem areas are identified; Implementation, in which potential solutions are implemented; and sustaining, in which strategies to sustain gains are discussed. Results\:\: The percentage of on-time start cases gradually increased to 100% in eight months, and was sustained above 85% in the following five months. Conclusion\:\: This project serves as a successful demonstration of how quality improvement can be effected in a complex, multidisciplinary workflow, which is the norm for many hospital procedures.

description125=When you enter a business, you enter a venture where learning never stops, new opportunities always rise and new competitions always enter the scene. Whatever the size of the business does not matter when it comes to new knowledge, yet somehow, being a startup and a small business owner has its own disadvantages obviously. Take us, for example. Axis Capital Group , a credit source offering small companies loan options located in Nebraska and now expands to Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia has had tough times. Even when we are starting, we compete with large credit companies with big names in the industry. We set ourselves apart from others through traditional methods which up until now has been very helpful in how we do our ways.  1. Define yourself and your business’ culture Authenticity is key – be yourself. You cannot keep your business when you act all fraudulent about things. This frame of mind is essential in helping define your business’ culture. This can also be one of the factors in leading and setting the tone for your employees.  2. Keep track of your Long Term Goal At the outset of your new venture, you will likely spend all of your time with your nose to the grindstone, which can make it tough to see the big picture. While getting through daily operations matters, you should never lose sight of your long-term goal. When it comes to this, think big. Sure, you may have a sense of where you want to go in a two- or three-year plan, but think longer term. 3. A journal can be helpful It may be very hectic to run a small business firsthand and adding another task to the unending to-do list is typically an added stress. Nevertheless, take time to write down things you have done during the day. It may help you build a concrete outline of your thoughts and priorities.  4. Take a Leap and a little Risk Review what you have already achieved and what is left to achieve. In order for you to expand your business, you have to take a leap and look into the risk involved without putting those involved in jeopardy. Empower your employees to do the same. Let them make decisions and grow the business, and good results will follow. It will likely help foster your business’ culture and your reputation as a leader as well.

description119=The Heart Sutra is the apex of the Mahayana Buddhism thought.Buddhism developed from Theravada to Mahayana. Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Laos are essentially Theravada. Vietnam, China, Japan, Korea, Hongkong, Singapore, Taiwan, Tibet and Mongolia are essentially Mahayana. In this long development of Buddhism, the key concept of emptiness or void (SÅ©nya in Sanskrist) developed along.Life is non-permanent because everything comes and goes, depending on the law of causation. Life is therefore illusory, not real. In other words, life is emptiness. This conce pt of emptiness may easily lead to the negative thought of nihilism. Mahayana Buddhism takes us back out of this extremist concept of emptiness to the middle way. This middle way still commits to the idea that âlife is emptinessâ; however emptiness here is not different from existence--emptiness is existence, existence is emptiness. This middle way definitely takes away any inkling of nihilist negativism. It is realistic and positive about life. The Heart Sutra presents this middle way while going swiftly through all teachings of the Buddhist tradition, from Theravada to Mahayana. This sutra is so central to Mahayana Buddhism that it is recited daily by monks and nuns. Studying the Heart Sutra is really the studying of the whole Buddhism. http\://dotchuoinon.com/ebooks/

description113=This study compared the managerial motivations of library and information science (LIS) students in the United States with LIS students in India, Singapore, and Japan. The students responded to a questionnaire containing 41 statements on managerial motivation. These statements were divided into 10 categories\: task orientation, fear of success, perseverance, reaction to success/failure, future orientation, competitiveness, independence, rigidity, social needs, and acceptance of women as managers. Demographic factors such as educational attainment, age, marital status, and mobility were also compared. The respondents consisted of 665 students from 11 Southeastern universities in the United States, 814 students from 23 universities in India, 73 students from Singapore, and three students from Japan. A majority of the Indian, American, Singaporean, and Japanese LIS students were motivated to achieve the objectives they set for themselves and were future oriented. They were aggressive in setting their goals and expected that task orientation and perseverance would enable them to accomplish those objectives. The agreement percentages were close on task orientation, perseverance, future orientation, and competitiveness between countries and sexes. Differences between the sexes were found on factors like women as managers, reaction to success or failure, fear of failure, and social acceptance. (Contains 104 references.) (Author/MES)

description107=A study was done to test the assumptions faculty make about the relationship between teaching methods and educational objectives. Using a survey of staff and students involved in undergraduate courses in Building, Estate Management and Psychology at the National University of Singapore, the subjects were asked to rank order a set of 13 educational objectives in terms of importance. Staff were then asked how effective they thought different teaching methods were in meeting these objectives. Students were asked how effective they thought the teaching methods actually were for particular courses. The teaching methods considered included lectures, seminars, quantitative assignments, and student project work. The educational objectives included preparing for a future career, understanding concepts, developing problem solving skills, preparing for examinations, developing communications skills, and gathering information. The results indicate some discrepancies between staff assumptions and student perceptions of the relationship between educational objectives and different teaching methods. There was clear evidence that, though much university teaching is lecture based, this is not the best method for meeting all educational objectives. Project work and other active learning approaches may be more appropriate in many settings. Twenty seven references, a copy of the survey instrument, and four tables are included. (JB)

description101=During fiscal year (FY) 1989, the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) in Singapore offered full-time training at seven levels for secondary school leavers. The board's intake of 9,333 participants was 8% below the FY 1988 intake, a fact that was attributed to fewer primary school leavers. The introduction of the Revised Vocational Training System and strengthening of counseling services in the training institutes helped to sustain a high trainee progression rate and reduced the attrition rate. Continuing education and training included the following\: industrial skills, customized, and continuing education courses; Basic Education for Skills Training and Worker Improvement through Secondary Education programs, and industry-based training. An increased number of candidates sat for tests and examinations conducted by VITB. New strategic developments were as follows\: implementation of a perception study on vocational education, establishment of a Task Force on Apprenticeship to examine its expansion, and progress in the VITB Strategic Plan, including inservice education, textbook development, and initiation of a project on computerization of the institutes. The first certification scheme for a service occupation--that of retail sales assistant--was launched, VITB continued to promote vocational training to potential students through school visits and briefing of all final-year Institute of Education trainees. A 17-page statement of accounts is included as well as lists of course offered by VITB, VITB Training Institutes and Centers, organizations with VITB-approved training centers, and public trade texts available.

Abstract Background\: Viral envelope proteins are always proposed to exert important function during virus infection and replication. Vertebrate iridoviruses are enveloped large DNA virus, which can cause great economic losses in aquaculture and ecological destruction. Although numerous iridovirus envelope proteins have been identified using bioinformatics and proteomic methods, their roles in virus infection remained largely unknown. Methods\: Using SMART and TMHMM programs, we investigated the structural characteristics of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) VP19. A specific antibody against VP19 was generated and the expression profile of VP19 was clarified. The subcellular localization of VP19 in the absence or presence of other viral products was determined via transfection and immune fluorescence assay. In addition, Western blot assay and electron microscopy examination were performed to demonstrate whether SGIV VP19 was an envelope protein or a capsid protein. Results\: Here, SGIV VP19 was cloned and characterized. Among all sequenced iridoviruses, VP19 and its orthologues shared common features, including 19 invariant cysteines, a proline-rich motif and a predicted transmembrane domain. Subsequently, the protein synthesis of VP19 was only detected at the late stage of SGIV infection and inhibited obviously by treating with AraC, confirming that VP19 was a late expressed protein. Ectopic expression of EGFP-VP19 in vitro displayed a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm. In SGIV infected cells, the newly synthesized VP19 protein was initially localized in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern, and then aggregated into the virus assembly site at the late stage of SGIV infection, suggesting that other viral protein products were essential for VP19’s function during SGIV infection. In addition, Western blot assay and electron microscopy observation revealed that SGIV VP19 was associated with viral envelope, which was different from major capsid protein (MCP). Conclusion\: Taken together, the current data suggested that VP19 represented a conserved envelope protein in iridovirus, and might contribute greatly to virus assembly during virus infection.

description1997=This article is from BMC Nephrology , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an emerging public health problem worldwide. Previous studies have shown an association between blood pressure (BP) and CKD. However, it is not clear if there are ethnic differences in this association. We examined the association between BP and CKD in a multi-ethnic Asian population in Singapore. Methods\: We analysed data from three large population-based studies conducted between 2004–2011, (n\=3,167 Chinese, 3,082 Malays and 3,228 Indians) aged 40–80 years. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate

description1993=Operator Training Safeguarding heavy equipment operators starts with right training. Training should contain formal (classroom-type) instruction, demos by the trainer, practical exercises executed by the trainee, and an evaluation of the operator’s performance in the workplace. A common category of injury connected with heavy equipment consists of mounting and dismounting vehicles. The training offered should highlight using the 3-point contact rule\: Each operator mounting or dismounting a vehicle must retain contact with the vehicle by two hands and one foot or two feet and one hand until securely in the cab or on the ground.   Safety Rules To avoid complaints, the agency must correspondingly launch a set of safety rules and anticipations for operators when operating heavy equipment. The following is a incomplete list of rules and safe work practices that must be remembered by employees. Axis Capital Group, Singapore , a company is servicing many Southeast Asian countries such as KL Malaysia, Beijing China, Jakarta Indonesia and many more, requires proper training from job applicants, they added this list to ensure that all aspects of safety are addressed for heavy equipment operators.   Before operating\: Provide operator manuals for equipment operators and vehicle maintenance employees to review Ensure that operators wear appropriate clothing and protective equipment (hearing protection, work gloves, sturdy work shirt and pants, safety footwear, reflective vests, hard hat, etc.) Establish hand signals (if ground workers are present) Conduct regular vehicle inspections (use a daily sign in/inspection sheet) Make sure equipment has a rollover protective structure (ROPS) Fill tank with fuel when the equipment is cool with the engine off (no smoking) Inspect steps, handrails, pedals, grab irons, and cab floor for debris or defects   During operation\: Always wear seatbelts Check controls for proper operation (including backup alarms) Check the work area for obstacles, holes, overhead utility lines, etc. Have the utility service provider identify underground cables and supply lines before digging When working on slopes, operate up and down the face of the slope instead of across the face Never jump off of or onto the equipment (use 3-point contact rule) Never exit a running vehicle (turn the vehicle off if the operator must leave the cab)   Exiting the vehicle\: Park on level ground Relieve pressure from all hydraulic controls Wait for all motions to stop, then safely dismount the vehicle using 3-point contact rule Remove the key from unattended vehicles

description1985=This article is from Journal of Cardiovascular Disease Research , volume 2 . Abstract Background\:\: Researchers have determined that Indians face a higher risk of heart disease, despite the fact that nearly half of them are vegetarians and lack many of the other traditional risk factors. In the below-30 age group, coronary artery disease mortality among Indians is three-fold higher than in the whites in United Kingdom and ten-fold higher than the Chinese in Singapore. High levels of homocysteine have been widely linked to the early onset of heart diseases in other populations, although a definite proof among Indians is lacking, which needs to be investigated by way of screening for factors responsible for high homocysteine levels. Objective\:\: To screen for genetic factors responsible for hyperhomocysteinemia and the risk for premature coronary artery disease. Materials and Methods\:\: A total of 100 individuals with proven premature coronary artery disease and 200 age-and-sex matched controls were screened for polymorphisms in Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (C677T) Methionine synthase (MS) genes (A2756G, C2758G), and the B12 and Folate levels were estimated. Results\:\: Results from the mutational analysis revealed that in the study group, seven individuals had a polymorphism for the C677T allele in the MTHFR gene (one homozygous and six heterozygous) (Fischer's Exact test P > 0.046) (OR\: 0.2711 95% CI 0.0774 to 0.9491). Six were heterozygous for the A2756G polymorphism in the MS gene (Fischer's Exact test P > 0.0012). None showed a polymorphism at the C2758G allele in the MS gene. Four controls showed heterozygosity for the C677T polymorphism and none for the MS gene. The B12 and Folate levels were significantly lower in the study group as compared to the controls. Conclusions\:\: It is important to know which factors determine the total homocysteine concentrations. In the general population, the most important modifiable determinants of tHcy are folate intake and coffee consumption. Smoking and alcohol consumption are also associated with the total homocysteine concentrations, but more research is necessary to elucidate whether these relations are not originating from residual confounding due to other lifestyle factors.

description1982=This colloquium was held with the purposes of promoting cooperation and collaboration among engineering education institutions in the Mekong subregion and establishing the linkage with engineering institutions in France; to promote university-industry collaboration in the field of engineering and technology education; to establish a network of engineering and technology education in the region; and to plan for further cooperation between France and SEAMEO RIHED (Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization and Regional Center for Higher Education and Development) in the future. This report serves as a source of information not only for engineering and technology institutions and the educators who work there, but for the private sector as well. The report is divided into four sections\: (1) Introduction and Opening Speeches; (2) Papers (from France and Canada); (3) Country Reports (Cambodia, China [Yunnan], Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam); and (4) Recommendations. The Keynote Address, by Professor Roger G. H. Downer, provides insight into the problems and issues involved in the provision of quality engineering education in the region, and suggests remedies to be pursued. The papers are as follows\: "Pan-European Training\: the Case of Cesi" (Monique Le May); "Trends in Engineering Education" (Jean Francois Mela); "How To Become a Qualified Engineer by Apprenticeship" (Christian Rumelhard); "The Challenges of Cooperative Engineering Education" (G. E. Schneider); "Thai-Canadian Collaboration in Human Resource Development" (S. A. Boctor);"Quality Assurance in Engineering Education\: Engineering Accreditation in Canada" (F. Hamdullahpur); and "University-Industry Linkages in Environmental Engineering" (L. Otten.) Two annexes contain a program and a list of participants. (AEF)

description1980=Using a Vygotskian perspective, this study investigated the possibility of secondary school second language students providing scaffolding for each other's learning during dyadic verbal interaction on a dictogloss task. Participants in the study were 19 English-as-a-Second-Language students from China, Hong Kong, and Korea, who studied at a girl's school in Singapore. The researchers examined the students' exchanges for the presence of discourse strategies that occur in the zone of proximal development. To understand the students' socio-affective responses to collaborative work and the effect of these responses on the quality of their dyadic interaction, data were collected via student journals, questionnaires, and interviews. Findings suggest that the second language students were capable of providing assisted performance, though in many ways that are different from that given by experts to novices in the traditional notion of scaffolding. Further, the socio-affective factors may also play a key role in the success or failure of scaffolding. The implications of this study makes the case for the validity of student-student interaction as a tool for second language learning, while suggesting the need for collaborative skills to be taught and for students to understand the value of cooperation.

description1974=Land scarcity dominates the thinking of school planners in Singapore. Techniques for optimizing the use of land for schools include (1) the construction of multi-storied or high-rise schools; (2) operation of a double-shift system and, in some cases, a triple-shift system; (3) multiple use of educational spaces; and (4) construction of several schools in combination on the same site. This case study of the design of secondary schools in Singapore includes a review of the curriculum and explains how this has been translated into spacial requirements, building layout, and site layout. Methods of school mapping (planning the location of new schools to provide maximum service) are explained. An organizational chart shows the government departments and statutory boards that are involved in planning and building schools. Illustrations show the layout of science laboratories, home economics laboratories, workshops, craft rooms, resource centers, canteens, and sports facilities. The report concludes with a chapter on construction costs. (Author/MLF)

description1971=Since at least the 1980s, motivated, in part, by findings from international comparisons of students' mathematics achievement, some American (U.S.) educators and policy makers have initiated educational reform that focuses on improving teaching practices and curriculum designs by advocating for the adoption of Asian educational models. The implicit assumption behind such reform seems to overlook the possible roles of outside of school factors in superior academic performance in the Asian countries. The purpose of this study was to investigate how outside of school factors were related to students' TIMSS mathematics achievement for the U.S and five top-performing Asian nations or regions, and to examine whether the relative role of school-associated and outside of school factors was consistent across these five Asian countries. The results indicated that students' achievement was highly related to outside of school factors across all six countries. For Singapore and Hong Kong, school-associated factors had somewhat more salient roles than the outside of school factors. However, for Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, school-associated factors played lessor roles in students' achievement performance. As for the U.S., school-associated factors were related to students' performance, however outside of school factors clearly played more salient roles than the school-associated factors. The findings suggest that students' mathematics achievement covaries substantially with outside of school factors. Hence, students' superior mathematics achievement does not necessarily reflect only a superior public school system but also outside of school factors. (Contains 10 tables and 2 figures.)

description1970=This paper explains the results of a survey of students' ideas about food as a scientific concept. The survey found that high school students in Singapore (n\=66) displayed an anthropocentric view of food that was not generally applied across living organisms in heterotrophs (animals) or autotrophs (plants) as a whole. It is also noted that students understood the components of a balanced diet but confused the concepts of nutrients and water, believing the latter to be a food. Students felt that the biological functions of food are for sustenance, satiation, growth, and general well-being. They seemed to hold a simplistic view that anything that is edible is considered a food. (Contains 18 references.) (WRM)

description1966=Vaak zien we bedrijven die groot succes hebben opgedaan beweren dat hun prestaties waren te wijten aan hun professionele teams van werknemers die ijverig hun expertise toe te passen op een consistente wijze voor vele jaren. En dit is bijna altijd het geval is en kan worden vastgesteld als de onderliggende feit in alle gevallen. Toch, als we komen er over nadenk, professionaliteit kan worden geleerd en opgedaan door jaren van training en inprenting door de beste mentoren met behulp van de beste principes en instrumenten van het onderwijs zonder dat de persoon zichzelf volledig accepteren van de ultieme drijfveer voor het gehele proces. Wat bedoelen we daarmee? Denk aan de soldaat die door middel van Boot Camp gaat. Alle harde training en discipline wordt gelijk afgeleverd deze soldaat alsmede elk ander soldaat in een heel leger. We eindigen met een goed georganiseerde en goed getraind leger, compleet met de nieuwste wapens beschikbaar. Maar toch, dat betekent niet dat het leger dat het zal winnen alle gevechten zal deelnemen aan verzekeren. Een meer superieur leger, niet alleen in aantal, maar in de prestaties onder bepaalde omstandigheden kan overwinning te behalen als gevolg van de algehele begrip van de factoren die zorgen voor een zegevierende aanval tegen een vijand kracht. De individuele zaken, hetzij in een leger of een zakelijke onderneming. Maar wat belangrijker is de manier waarop de verschillende onderdelen worden beheerd en gecontroleerd om het gemeenschappelijke doel te bereiken voor het hele team, niet alleen voor het individu. Een soldaat in staat zijn om zo veel vijanden te schieten; maar als de vijand uiteindelijk verkrijgen van meer gronden Hierdoor hoeft de individuele punten niet toe. U kunt de hoogste shooter in uw basketbalteam en toch verliest het spel. Professionaliteit en efficiëntie is niet alleen in de uiterlijke uitvoering van iemands taken, maar in het hart. Het is een interne kwaliteit die de gehele organisatie doordringt en laat de hele organisatie te gedragen als een organisme het was bedoeld om te functioneren. Het bijenvolk is het beste voorbeeld dat we kunnen presenteren. Elke bee is een perfecte drager van de cultuur van de kolonie. Het handhaaft de optimale efficiëntie op het gebied van de jacht en het oogsten van honing. Elke honingbij heeft niet alleen de mogelijkheid te ruiken uit nectar-zware bloemen, het heeft ook de vaardigheden om andere bijen te helpen om inefficiënte bewegingen te voorkomen. We weten nu dat een bij, na de oogst nectar van een bepaalde bloem, markeert dat bloem als al leeg door een geur laat, waarschuwen anderen om het te omzeilen. True professionaliteit, daarom maakt werknemers te ruiken het beste klanten en om anderen te vertellen dat de slechte klanten zijn rond en moeten worden vermeden. Het gaat ook met mogelijke slechte beslissingen of slechte investering keuzes die kunnen worden aangetroffen langs de weg. Dergelijke vaardigheden kunnen worden verworven door middel van training, moeten we toegeven. Maar het duurt extra passie, niet alleen training, om het niveau van het vermogen dat mensen in staat stelt om grotere uitdagingen te overwinnen en meer intense risico's te aanvaarden om hogere doelen gewoonlijk niet genomen door andere mensen te bereiken ontwikkelen. Het is de extra rand in innovatieve en ondernemende kracht die het beste uit het goede bepaalt. Echte professionaliteit is van het hart, niet alleen van de geest. Begrijpen hoe het hart werkt en u die rand te krijgen over degenen die alleen maar leren. Waarom? Omdat het hart vereist diepere zorg en een grotere verbeelding, niet alleen louter kennis en routine. Aztec begrijpt de weg naar een succesvolle organisatie. Mensen materie en ze moeten worden erkend en dienovereenkomstig beloond. Maar voor degenen die echt professioneel in hart en nieren, de compensatie komt voor de beloning. De uitdaging van het werk, het doen van het werk en de voltooiing van de werkzaamheden zijn één en dezelfde. Net als de jager die ruikt en hoort de doden nog voordat het wordt gezien, het avontuur en de vreugde van iets te doen wordt geleverd met de doen zelf. Iedereen die doet zijn of haar best wordt beloond door hebben gedaan wat er moet ook worden gedaan als de verworven werkelijke materiële voordelen.

Though, there are certain benefits of leasing the machines which are more or less similar in all ranges of the construction industry, regardless of the category of equipment.

description1954=Dear Reader, No Starch Press and I have decided to release this free ebook version of Hacking the Xbox in honor of Aaron Swartz. As you read this book, I hope that you’ll be reminded of how important freedom is to the hacking community and that you’ll be inclined to support the causes that Aaron believed in. I agreed to release this book for free in part because Aaron’s treatment by MIT is not unfamiliar to me. In this book, you will find the story of when I was an MIT graduate student, extracting security keys from the original Microsoft Xbox. You’ll also read about the crushing disappointment of receiving a letter from MIT legal repudiating any association with my work, effectively leaving me on my own to face Microsoft. The difference was that the faculty of my lab, the AI laboratory, were outraged by this treatment. They openly defied MIT legal and vowed to publish my work as an official “AI Lab Memo,” thereby granting me greater negotiating leverage with Microsoft. Microsoft, mindful of the potential backlash from the court of public opinion over suing a legitimate academic researcher, came to a civil understanding with me over the issue. It saddens me that America’s so-called government for the people, by the people, and of the people has less compassion and enlightenment toward their fellow man than a corporation. Having been a party to subsequent legal bullying by other entities, I am all too familiar with how ugly and gut-wrenching a high-stakes lawsuit can be. Fortunately, the stakes in my cases were not as high, nor were my adversaries as formidable as Aaron’s, or I too might have succumbed to hopelessness and fear. A few years ago, I started rebuilding my life overseas, and I find a quantum of solace in the thought that my residence abroad makes it a little more difficult to be served. While the US legal system strives for justice, the rules of the system create an asymmetric war that favors those with resources. By and far one of the most effective methods to force a conclusion, right or wrong, against a small player is to simply bleed them of resources and the will to fight through pre-trial antics. Your entire life feels like it is under an electron microscope, with every tiny blemish magnified into a pitched battle of motions, countermotions, discovery, subpoenas, and affidavits, and each action heaping tens of thousands of dollars onto your legal bill. Your friends, co-workers, employers, and family are drawn into this circus of humiliation as witnesses. Worse, you’re counseled not to speak candidly to anyone, lest they be summoned as a witness against you. Isolated and afraid, it eventually makes more sense to roll over and settle than to take the risk of losing on a technicality versus a better-funded adversary, regardless of the justice. The US government is far and away the best-funded and fearsome enemy in the world, and copyright law has some unusually large, if not cruel, penalties associated with it. I never knew Aaron, but I feel that the magnitude of the bullying he was subjected to is reflected in his decision to end his life. I echo Larry Lessig’s notion that the US legal system needs a sense of shame. To an outsider like me, it seems that certain prosecutors in the US government are obsessed with making a name for themselves at the expenses of the individuals they pursue. Winning cases gains them the recognition and credibility needed for promotions and assignments to ever higher profile cases. For them, it’s not about justice—it’s about victory and self-aggrandizement. This system of incentives contributes to the shameless bullying of individuals and small entities who have the guts to stand up and do something daring. Individuals are robbed of the will and strength to fight for what they feel is right, as the mere act of prosecution can be as much a punishment as the verdict. As a result, I fear that the era of civil disobedience may be coming to a close. As people, as individuals, as hackers, we need to oppose this trend and continue to do what we feel deep down in our hearts is right. While Aaron's story came to a tragic end, I hope that in this book you will find an encouraging story with a happy ending. Without the right to tinker and explore, we risk becoming enslaved by technology; and the more we exercise the right to hack, the harder it will be to take that right away. bunnie Singapore, March 2013 Demand Progress GiveWell Electronic Frontier Foundation

description1948=Thesis advisor(s)\: McEachen, John\n"March 2000."\nThesis (M.S. in Electrical Engineering) Naval Postgraduate School, March 2000\nIncludes bibliographical references (p. 135)\nThe objective of this work is to perform simulation modeling of the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) network with particular emphasis on modeling of the Message Transfer Part Level 2. The basics of common channel signaling using Signaling System No. 7 is initially outlined and discussed with reference to the ITU-T Q.7xx-Series Recommendations. This includes the protocol stack, signaling points, signaling links and typical network structure. In particular, the functionality of the Message Transfer Part, which provides the main mechanism to convey signaling messages, is discussed in detail. Subsequently the modeling of the Message Transfer Part, in particular MTP level 2, using the simulation tool OPNET from MIL3. Inc. is presented. The model uses a multi-layer modular approach, with each layer corresponding to the SS7 layer it is modeling. The functional blocks within each layer are thought of as processes. With their buffers and processors, these processes form a complex interlinked queuing model that is complicated to analyze but is readily simulated. In order to illustrate the use of the simulation model, the basic linkset delay between two signaling points under a heavy traffic load is simulated and compared with analysis based on M/G/1 queuing models\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat reader\nNational University of Singapore author (civilian)\nupdated dlb 10/3/06\n
description1947=Nano-scale particles of polypyrrole (PPy) have been synthesized by polymerizing the respective monomer in the presence of its substituted homologue with oxyethylene (POE) oligomers as the substitute groups. The polymerization was carried out by introducing an aqueous solution of oxidant into the tetrahydrofurane (THF) solution of the monomers. The particles obtained possess brush-like architectures in the dispersing medium and their sizes in dry state fall into the range of 10 to 40 nm according to TEM analysis. When dispersed by a low content (&lt;0.1 wt %) in an aprotic organic solvent the nanoparticles synthesized have been found to affect the conduction of lithium ion. The effect is interpreted as a significant reduction in the electrical resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface according to gain-phase impedance measurement. This has been attributed to the mediating role of the graft POE chains on the colloidal particles.

Drawing on empirical research conducted in both urban and rural areas, the book situates young people’s experiences of homelessness within a theoretical framework that connects embodied identities and relationships with processes of social change. The book theorises a ‘symbolic economy of youth homelessness’ that encompasses the subjective, aesthetic, and relational dimensions of homelessness. This theory shows the personal, interpersonal and affective suffering that is caused by the relations of power and privilege that produce contemporary youth homelessness. The book is unique in the way in which it places youth homelessness within the wider contexts of inequality, and social change. Whilst contemporary discussions of youth homelessness understand the topic as a discrete ‘social problem’, this book demonstrates the position that youth homelessness occupies within wider social processes, inequalities, and theoretical debates, addressing theories of social change in late modernity and their relationship to the cultural construction of youth. These theoretical debates are made concrete by means of an exploration of an important form of contemporary inequality\: youth homelessness\n

description1940=Written more than twenty years ago, this book is one of the most creative and original works of a Muslim thinker in the contemporary Muslim world. The author deals with fundamental problems faced by contemporary Muslims and provides real solutions, beginning with a discussion on ‘The Contemporary Western Christian Background’ in Chapter (I), followed by his analysis of the concepts (which he newly defines) of ‘secular’, ‘secularization’, and ‘secularism’ in Chapter (II). All this is then contrasted in Chapter (IV) of the book entitled ‘Islam\: The Concept of Religion and the Foundation of Ethics and Morality’. Based on all the preceding explanation, the author proceeds to analyze the Muslim ‘dilemma’ by declaring that it should be resolved primarily through what he calls the “dewesternization of knowledge” or, conversely, the “islamization of contemporary knowledge”, an original concept conceived and elucidated by the author for the past three decades. Numerous original and profound ideas are contained in this book—arrived at chiefly through critical study of the Muslim tradition—such as the concepts of din,‘adl, hikmah, adab, ma‘na, and ta’dib, and their significance in the development of an Islamic system of education. The rationale for the islamization of contemporary knowledge and the establishment of a truly Islamic university was in fact provided for the first time in contemporary Muslim thought by this author long before the appearance of the present book, which explains these interconnected subjects more concisely. Further, the appendix entitled, ‘On Islamization\: The Case of the Malay-Indonesian Archipelago’ is an actual explanation and application of the seminal ideas discussed in the book. This is a must read for all Muslims and those concerned with the problems and effects of secularization in our world today. This book has been translated into most of the major Islamic languages of the world— Turkish, Arabic, Urdu, Indonesian, Bosnian, and Persian. Description from the publisher\: Information about the author — Syed Muhammad Naquib bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Muhsin al-Attas (1931-) Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas, born September 5, 1931 in Bogor, Java, is a prominent contemporary Muslim thinker. He is one of the few contemporary scholars who is thoroughly rooted in the traditional Islamic sciences and who is equally competent in theology, philosophy, metaphysics, history, and literature. His thought is integrated, multifaceted and creative. Al-Attas’ philosophy and methodology of education have one goal\: Islamization of the mind, body and soul and its effects on the personal and collective life on Muslims as well as others, including the spiritual and physical non-human environment. He is the author of twenty-seven authoritative works on various aspects of Islamic thought and civilization, particularly on Sufism, cosmology, metaphysics, philosophy and Malay language and literature. Al-Attas was born into a family with a history of illustrious ancestors, saints, and scholars. He received a thorough education in Islamic sciences, Malay language, literature and culture. His formal primary education began at age 5 in Johor, Malaysia, but during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia, he went to school in Java, in Madrasah Al-`Urwatu’l-wuthqa, studying in Arabic. After World War II in 1946 he returned to Johor to complete his secondary education. He was exposed to Malay literature, history, religion, and western classics in English, and in a cultured social atmosphere developed a keen aesthetic sensitivity. This nurtured in al-Attas an exquisite style and precise vocabulary that were unique to his Malay writings and language. After al-Attas finished secondary school in 1951, he entered the Malay Regiment as cadet officer no. 6675. There he was selected to study at Eton Hall, Chester, Wales and later at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, England (952 -55). This gave him insight into the spirit and style of British society. During this time he was drawn to the metaphysics of the Sufis, especially works of Jami, which he found in the library of the Academy. He traveled widely, drawn especially to Spain and North Africa where Islamic heritage had a profound influence on him. Al-Attas felt the need to study, and voluntarily resigned from the King’s Commission to serve in the Royal Malay Regiment, in order to pursue studies at the University of Malaya in Singapore 1957-59. While undergraduate at University of Malay, he wrote Rangkaian Ruba`iyat, a literary work, and Some Aspects of Sufism as Understood and Practised among the Malays. He was awarded the Canada Council Fellowship for three years of study at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University in Montreal. He received the M.A. degree with distinction in Islamic philosophy in 1962, with his thesis “Raniri and the Wujudiyyah of 17th Century Acheh” . Al-Attas went on to the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London where he worked with Professor A. J. Arberry of Cambridge and Dr. Martin Lings. His doctoral thesis (1962) was a two-volume work on the mysticism of Hamzah Fansuri. In 1965, Dr. al-Attas returned to Malaysia and became Head of the Division of Literature in the Department of Malay Studies at the University of Malay, Kuala Lumpur. He was Dean of the Faculty of Arts from 1968-70. Thereafter he moved to the new National University of Malaysia, as Head of the Department of Malay Language and Literature and then Dean of the Faculty of Arts. He strongly advocated the use of Malay as the language of instruction at the university level and proposed an integrated method of studying Malay language, literature and culture so that the role and influence of Islam and its relationship with other languages and cultures would be studied with clarity. He founded and directed the Institute of Malay Language, Literature, and Culture (IBKKM) at the National University of Malaysia in 1973 to carry out his vision. In 1987, with al-Attas as founder and director, the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization (ISTAC) was established in Kuala-Lumpur. This institution strives to bring an integrated Islamization into the consciousness of its students and faculty. Al-Attas envisioned the plan and design of every aspect of ISTAC, and has incorporated Islamic artistic and architectural principles throughout the campus and grounds. Al-Attas maintains that modern science sees things as mere things, and that it has reduced the study of the phenomenal world to an end in itself. Certainly this has brought material benefits, however it is accompanied by an uncontrollable and insatiable propensity to destroy nature itself. Al-Attas maintains a firm critique that to study and use nature without a higher spiritual end has brought mankind to the state of thinking that men are gods or His co-partners. “Devoid of real purpose, the pursuit of knowledge becomes a deviation from the truth, which necessarily puts into question the validity of such knowledge. [Islam and Secularism, p.36] Al-Attas views Western civilization as constantly changing and ‘becoming’ without ever achieving ‘being’. He analyzes that many institutions and nations are influenced by this spirit of the West and they continually revise and change their basic developmental goals and educational objectives to follow the trends from the West. He points to Islamic metaphysics which shows that Reality is composed of both permanence and change; the underlying permanent aspects of the external world are perpetually undergoing change [Islam and Secularism, p.82] For al-Attas, Islamic metaphysics is a unified system that discloses the ultimate nature of Reality in positive terms, integrating reason and experience with other higher orders in the suprarational and transempirical levels of human consciousness. He sees this from the perspective of philosophical Sufism. “No formulation of a philosophy of education and a philosophy of science along Islamic lines can be developed by ignoring the great contributions of the Sufi masters on the ultimate nature of reality.” [in the conclusion of his Commentary on Hujjat al-Siddiq]. Al-Attas says that the Essentialist and the Existentialists schools of the Islamic tradition address the nature of reality. The first is represented by philosophers and theologians, and the latter by Sufis. The Essentialists cling to the principle of mahiyyah (quiddity), whereas the Existentialists are rooted in wujud (the fundamental reality of existence) which is direct intuitive experience, not merely based on rational analysis or discursive reasoning. This has undoubtedly led philosophical and scientific speculations to be preoccupied with things and their essences at the expense of existence itself, thereby making the study of nature an end in itself. Al-Attas maintains that in the extra-mental reality, it is wujud (Existence) that is the real ‘essences’ of things and that what is conceptually posited as mahiyyah (‘essences’ or ‘quiddities’) are in reality accidents of existence. This is al-Haqq, the Truth, a wajh (aspect) of God. [Intuition of Existence, p. 6, 7] The process of creation or bringing into existence and annihilation or returning to non-existence, and recreation of similars is a dynamic existential movement. There is a principle of unity and a principle of diversity in creation. “The multiplicity of existents that results is not in the one reality of existence, but in the manifold aspects of the recipients of existence in the various degrees, each according to its strength or weakness, perfection or imperfection, and priority or posteriority. Thus the multiplicity of existents does not impair the unity of existence, for each existent is a mode of existence and does not have a separate ontological status” [On Quiddity and Essence, p.33]. He clarifies that the Essence of God is absolutely transcendent and is unknown and unknowable, except to Himself, whereas the essence or reality of a thing consists of a mode of existence providing the permanent aspect of the thing, and its quiddity, endowing it with its changing qualities. Al-Attas makes no attempts to accommodate modern Western scientific spirit through a reinterpretation of Islam, or to naively import Western technological skills and products while simultaneously keeping intact the traditional understanding of religion. Problems in the world, he says, are not because of illiteracy or ignorance of modern knowledge; the reasons are epistemological and metaphysical. Modern sciences must be acquired, but their philosophical foundations must be recast into the Islamic metaphysical framework. “We do affirm that religion is in harmony with science. But this does not mean that religion is in harmony with modern scientific methodology and philosophy of science. Since there is no science that is free of value, we must intelligently investigate and study the values and judgments that are inherent in, or aligned to, the presuppositions and interpretations of modern science. We must not indifferently and uncritically accept each new scientific or philosophical theory without first understanding its implication and testing the validity of values that go along with the theory. Islam possesses within itself the source of its claim to truth, and does not need scientific or philosophical theories to justify such a claim. Moreover, it is not the concern of Islam to fear scientific discoveries that could contradict the validity of its truth.” [Prolegomena, p. 38] Islamic science must interpret the facts of existence in correspondence with the Qur’anic system of conceptual interrelations and its methods of interpretation, not the other way around, by interpreting the system in correspondence with the facts. Since the role of science is to be descriptive of facts, and facts undergo continual change by virtue of their underlying reality which is process, modern philosophy and science, in a secular way, consider change to be the ultimate nature of reality. Al-Attas maintains that reality is at once both permanence and change, not in the sense that change is permanent, but in the sense that there is something permanent whereby change occurs. Change does not occur at the level of phenomenal things, for they are ever-perishing, but at the level of their realities which contain within themselves all their future states. Al-Attas advocates that the categories of knowledge which were fundamental to the Islamic tradition are fundamental to any real modern education. In the traditional Islamic worldview, knowledge was of two kinds, the open-ended fard kifayah knowledge, which includes the natural, physical and applied sciences, and the fard `ayn, the absolute nature of the knowledge pertaining to God and the spiritual realities and moral truths. Fard `ayn knowledge is not static, but dynamic, and it increases according to the spiritual and intellectual abilities as well as social and professional responsibilities of a person. Contemporary modern knowledge needs to be delivered from its interpretations based on secular ideology. This requires “a critical examination of the methods of modern science; its concepts, presuppositions, and symbols; its empirical and rational aspects, and those impinging upon values and ethics; its interpretations of origins; its theory of knowledge; its presuppositions on the existence of an external world, of the uniformity of nature and of the rationality of natural processes; its theory of the universe; its classification of the sciences; its limitations and inter-relations with one another of the sciences, and its social relations” [Prolegomena, p. 114]. Science, according to Al-Attas, is a kind of ta’wil or allegorical interpretation of the empirical things that constitute the world of nature [Islam and the Philosophy of Science, p. 116]. The natural world is a book with knowledge; but that knowledge is not evident merely from the physical phenomena; they are nothing but signs, the meaning of which can be understood by those who are equipped with proper knowledge, wisdom and spiritual discernment. Some natural phenomena are obvious as to their meaning, while other natural things are ambiguous; similarly there are clear verses (muhkamat) of the Qur’an, while other verses are ambiguous (mutashabihat). The scientifically relevant verses in the Qur’an necessarily open themselves for further interpretation, based on the cumulative knowledge of future generations. He says that the fact that the early Muslims were not cognizant of the many scientific truths embedded in the Qur’an proves that the discoveries of these truths will not contradict its universal spiritual and religious-moral teachings. The signs of the external world must be understood via the same method as the valid interpretation and understanding of the written words of the Qur’an, namely through tafsir (direct interpretation) and ta’wil, a deeper and allegorical interpretation based on the clear and direct words. Similarly, religion is constituted by established (i.e. Shari`ah) and ambiguous (Haqiqah), aspects of the same reality and truth, and the reality of the latter is based upon the established truth of the former. [Commentary on Hujjat al-Siddi, p. 183] Al-Attas says that the constituent parts of the fundamental bases of Islamic metaphysics are\: the primacy of the reality of existence; the dynamic nature of this reality that is continually unfolding itself in systematic gradation from the degrees of absoluteness to those of manifestation; determination, and individuation; the perpetual process of the new creation; the absence of a necessary relation between cause and effect and its explanation in the Divine causality; the third metaphysical category between existence and non-existence (the realm of the permanent entities); and the metaphysics of change and permanence pertaining to the realities. It is within the framework of this metaphysics that the philosophy of science must be formulated. [Islam and the Philosophy of Science, p. 35, 36]

description1935=This article is from Asia Pacific Family Medicine , volume 13 . Abstract It is crucial to adapt and improve the (primary) health care systems of countries to prepare for future patient profiles and their related needs. The main aim of this study was to acquire a comprehensive overview of the perceptions of primary care experts in Singapore about the state of primary care in Singapore, and to compare this with the state of primary care in other countries. Notwithstanding ranked 2nd in terms of efficiency of health care, Singapore is facing significant health care challenges. Emails were sent to 85 experts, where they were asked to rate Singapore’s primary care system based on nine internationally adopted health system characteristics and six practice characteristics (response rate \= 29%). The primary care system in Singapore received an average of 10.9 out of 30 possible points. Lowest ratings were given to\: earnings of primary care physicians compared to specialists, requirement for 24 hr accessibility of primary care services, standard of family medicine in academic departments, reflection of community served by practices in patient lists, and the access to specialists without needing to be referred by primary care physicians. Singapore was categorized as a ‘low’ primary care country according to the experts.

Watch live Action Formula 1 Bahrain Grand Prix Streaming Live on your pc, MAC, mobile, android ,iphone, Laptop, or many other electronic device, so keep watching Bahrain Grand Prix Race Online.2017 Formula 1 live stream Race Formula 1 online.The Bahrain Grand Prix is a Formula One Championship race in Bahrain sponsored by Gulf Air. The first race took place at the Bahrain International Circuit on 4 April 2004. It made history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East, and was given the award for the "Best Organised Grand Prix" by the FIA. The Bahrain Grand Prix has usually been the third race of the Formula One calendar. However, in the 2006 season, Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games. In 2010, Bahrain staged the opening race of the 2010 season and the cars drove the full 6.299 km (3.914 mi) "Endurance Circuit" to celebrate F1's 'diamond jubilee'. The 2011 Grand Prix, due to be held on 13 March, was cancelled on 21 February due to the 2011 Bahraini protests after drivers including Damon Hill and Mark Webber had protested. Human rights activists called for a cancellation of 2012 race due to reports of alleged human rights abuses committed by the Bahraini authorities.Team personnel also voiced concerns about safety,but the race, nonetheless, was held as planned on 22 April 2012. In 2014, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first staging of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the race was held as a night event under floodlights.In so doing it became the second Formula One night race after the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008. Bahrain's inaugural night event was won by Lewis Hamilton. Subsequent races have also been night races. Shortly after the Formula One February 2014 testing, Grand Prix organizers for Bahrain announced a decision to name the first corner of the iconic track after former seven-time champion German driver Michael Schumacher in honour of his achievements and also in support after the driver suffered an almost fatal skiing accident late December 2013.

description1904=We introduce the Singapore protocol, a qubit protocol for quantum key distribution that is fully tomographic, more efficient than other tomographic protocols, and very robust. Under ideal circumstances the efficiency is log_2(4/3)\=0.415 key bits per qubit sent. This is 25% more than the efficiency of 1/3\=0.333 for the standard six-state protocol, which sets the benchmark. We describe a simple two-way communication scheme that extracts 0.4 key bits per qubit and thus gets close to the information-theoretical limit. The noise thresholds that we report for a hierarchy of eavesdropping attacks demonstrate the robustness of the protocol\: A secure key can be extracted if there is less than 38.9% noise.

Olsen\nThesis (M.A. in National Security Affairs) Naval Postgraduate School, December 1997\nIncludes bibliographical references (p. 95-97)\nThis thesis analyzes the military capabilities of Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia and assesses their collective ability to control the use of the Straits of Malacca and the Singapore Straits. With steadily growing economies as a source of funding, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia have made significant improvements in their military stature. Collectively, they can control this vital passage, preventing both military and commercial shipping from using these straits. These three littoral nations' key interests that might lead them to restrict and deny the use of the Malacca Straits are identified. Their military force composition and capability also is reviewed\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat reader\nUS Navy (USN) author\ndk/dk cc\:9116 05/08/98\n

description1883=This volume presents papers presented at an international seminar conducted as part of the Six Nation Education Research Project, a project identifying aspects of higher education that currently confront educational systems in all countries. A keynote address by Robert Zemsky, titled "Seminar on Post-Massification," examines trends in the United States, including the price-income squeeze in access to higher education and the reduced demand for young workers, and suggests that such trends may generalize to other nations. Six country reports are then presented\: (1) "Massification of Higher Education and Academic Reforms in Japan" (Akira Arimoto); (2) "Trends in Higher Education from Massification to Post-Massification" (United States) (Patricia J. Gumport and others); (3) "Current Issues in Higher Education" (Switzerland) (Francois Grin, Christoph Metzger, and Andreas Gruner); (4) "Trends in University Reform in the Context of Massification" (Singapore) (S. Gopinathan and Susan B. Morriss); (5) "Reform and Development of China's Higher Education System in the Past Decade" (Wei Xin); and (6) "Higher Education in a Federal System" (Germany) (Wilfried Hartmann). Two summary papers are\: "Reforms as a Response to Massification of Higher Education\: A Comparative View" (Ulrich Teichler), and a commentary on conference discussions by Keith J. Morgan. Two special papers are also included\: "Approaches to Mass Higher Education\: A Comparison of Change in Britain and Australia" (Keith J. Morgan), and "Cross-National Study on Academic Organizational Reforms in Post-Massification Stage" (Akira Arimoto). (Individual papers contain references.) (DB)

John structures his presentation of the gospel around miracles and signs, interviews, worship and feast days and "I Am" statements. It was written at the end of the first century when John was an old man. The letters of John answer questions about the deity and humanity of Christ, assurance of salvation, brotherly love, rejection of the fallen world system and recognizing false teachers. Part of the "You Can Understand the Bible" series by Dr. Bob Utley, retired Professor of Hermeneutics (Bible interpretation).

description1876=China has the largest population and largest labor force in the world. It has been highly successful in rapidly expanding both secondary and higher education to a significant fraction of the youth cohort. However, educational opportunities and standards across China are highly uneven. China has abundant labor power, but it will need a far more skilled and productive labor force to meet its goals of developing an advanced, high-income economy and society. China is therefore now designing a new approach to human capital, including a major focus on developing a modern vocational education and training (VET) system. This report is part of an international comparative study of vocational and technical education systems undertaken by the Center on International Education Benchmarking (CIEB) of the U.S.-based National Center on Education and the Economy (NCEE). It builds on NCEE's long track record of analyzing the critical connections between education and economic growth. According to human capital theory, knowledge and skills have become the most important force driving modern economies. Therefore, countries are investing increasing amounts of their GDP in education. Many countries have focused on expanding higher education to increasing segments of the age cohort while vocational education and training, often associated with an older industrial era, has been relatively neglected. But slow economic growth, high unemployment, including among college graduates, and rising inequality has made developing a modern VET system--as a vehicle for meaningful career preparation for a more demanding labor market--an issue of increasing urgency around the globe. This CIEB international study, which also includes case studies of Australia, Denmark, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United States as well as China, is an effort to assess what are the world's best practices in vocational and technical education in the 21st century. This case study of China is the result of several visits to China in 2013 and 2014 by the study team of Marc Tucker, Vivien Stewart, Betsy Brown Ruzzi and Nancy Hoffman. This study examines the success of China's unique dual-track, export-led economy from 1978 until 2009 and explains where the skills came from to build this economic juggernaut. It describes the turning point it now faces and the reasons China's economic model going forward will require far higher levels of skill and productivity. This is the context in which China is trying to develop a modern VET system. The author compares China's current vocational education and training system to the best practices of the world's most advanced systems to which it aspires. While it is found that the VET system is lacking in many respects, China's recent history has shown that when it decides to tackle a problem, it has the determination and drive to accomplish it.
description1875=This workshop was designed to discuss the role of out-of-school science activities both in formal and non-formal education programs. Fifteen participants from Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand attended the workshop.

description1874=Although education and training should be a source of relative advantage for Australia, the competitive benefits expected from the nation's "clever country" strategy have been slow to emerge. When 22 countries including Australia, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, United States, and New Zealand were compared from the standpoint of 8 factors contributing to national competitiveness, 17 countries were deemed more competitive than Australia. Three factors (infrastructure, government, and people) were identified as likely drivers of Australian competitiveness, and three others (internationalization, domestic economic strength, and science and technology) were identified as likely restraints on competitiveness. The following strategies for improving the competitiveness of Australian work skills were proposed\: match qualification growth of key competitors; develop an integrated qualification framework that can be applied to post-compulsory schooling and vocational programs; address Australia's post-compulsory profile gap and profile age gap; improve the alignment of education and training and industry work skill priorities; and use ongoing benchmarking and evaluation processes to implement effective continuous improvement strategies for education and training. (Thirty-one tables/figures are included. Appended are the following\: comment on the development of comparative qualification frameworks; alternative Australian qualification measures; and procedures for measuring the relationship between qualification stocks and national competitiveness.)

description1870=Background\: As the sole teacher provider in Singapore, the National Institute of Education (NIE) prepares all new teachers for the Singapore's Education System. In the last decade, NIE's enrolments for initial teacher preparation programmes have grown significantly. There has been a parallel increase in the number of career changers entering the teaching profession. This article explores why a number of career changers entered the field of education as well as their perception of the field of teaching. Aims\: To investigate key factors and reasons why career changes choose teaching as a second career. Sample\: A research survey was administered to 80 Postgraduate-in-Education (Primary) programme student teachers who chose teaching as a second career. This paper presents the survey findings on their reasons for choosing teaching as a career. The paper also reports the interviews of 4 randomly selected second career student teachers in the programme and the perspectives that they bring into the teaching profession. Method\: Survey and interviews were conducted and the responses received were tabulated. Results\: The results found that second-career teachers do not consider the lower compensation associated with the new profession as the main decisive factor for choosing teaching. The trade-off is the increased personal satisfaction. Conclusion\: It is also important to help second career teachers make connections between prior work and teaching. With increased numbers of career changers entering the field of teaching, an important factor to seriously consider is how to fulfill the expectations of the second career changers in those intrinsic and altruistic motives that they deem important.

description1859=This final report describes the activities and conclusions of the Second Sub-Regional Workshop on Teacher Education held in November 1971. The program was organized by the Asian Institute for Teacher Educators, Quezon City, Philippines, with the cooperation of UNESCO. The government of Thailand helped organize the program for the following group of member states\: Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, and Thailand. The program centered around seminars on the progress of teacher education in the participating Asian member states, seminars on integration and modernization, and workshops on integration and modernization (applying a systems approach to integration and modernization of teacher education). Three general conclusions found a) lack of relevance to existing social needs and aspirations, b) divergence between theory and practices, and c) divergence between training institutions and school systems. Further conclusions dealt with integrated curriculum, research, teaching procedures, methods and techniques, social relevance of teacher education and status of teachers. Appendixes include lists of officeholders, participants, and observers; agenda and work schedules; and lists of participants in the working groups. Speeches, figures, diagrams, and tables are included. (MJM)

description1832=Thesis advisor(s)\: Edward A. Olsen\n"June 1994"\nThesis (M.S. in International Resource Planning and Management) Naval Postgraduate School, June 1994\nBibliography\: p. 80-84\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been in existence for more than 25 years. Its member nations, (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) have emphasized the role of the association as a neutral organization based on cooperation among members in the spirit of equality and partnership that would bring mutual benefits and stimulate solidarity which can contribute to building the foundation of peace, stability, and prosperity in the ASEAN region in particular and the world in general. With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the. Soviet Union, this thesis will try to examine the relevance of ASEAN's original intention in the formation of the organization. With the 2uncertainty of the US military presence in the region, Japan's growing military capabilities, China's continuous military modernization, and other developments in the region, is it necessary for the ASEAN to be transformed into a defense and security alliance? Is the ASEAN capable of forming a military defense pact? Finally, this thesis will examine the future and prospect of the ASEAN as a regional organization\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat Reader\nPhilippine Army author\n

description1830=This article is from Diabetic Foot & Ankle , volume 5 . Abstract Background\: This paper describes the surgical technique of a modified Pirogoff's amputation performed by the senior author and reports the results of this operation in a single surgeon case series for patients with diabetic foot infections. Methods\: Six patients with diabetic foot infections were operated on by the National University Hospital (NUH) diabetic foot team in Singapore between November 2011 and January 2012. All patients underwent a modified Pirogoff's amputation for diabetic foot infections. Inclusion criteria included the presence of a palpable posterior tibial pulse, ankle brachial index (ABI) of more than 0.7, and distal infections not extending proximally beyond the midfoot level. Clinical parameters such as presence of pulses and ABI were recorded. Preoperative blood tests performed included a glycated hemoglobin level, hemoglobin, total white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, and creatinine levels. All patients were subjected to 14 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy postoperatively and were followed up for a minimum of 10 months. Results\: All six patients had good wound healing. Tibio-calcaneal arthrodesis of the stump was achieved in all cases by 6 months postoperatively. All patients were able to walk with the prosthesis. Conclusions\: The modified Pirogoff's amputation has been found to show good results in carefully selected patients with diabetic foot infections. The selection criteria included a palpable posterior tibial pulse, distal infections not extending proximally beyond the midfoot level, ABI of more than 0.7, hemoglobin level of more than 10 g/dL, and serum albumin level of more than 30 g/L.

description1824=Based on research conducted in 1996 and 1999, this paper discusses theoretical issues and provides an overview of the purposes for which school libraries are creating and maintaining home pages or World Wide Web sites. In 1996, a content analysis was performed of Web sites of 50 school libraries in the United States, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Singapore, Iceland, Kuwait, New Zealand, and Norway. A longitudinal study was designed in 1999 to examine\: whether the Web pages/sites included in the 1996 study have been developed further or improved; the current "state of the art" in terms of school library Web sites; overall improvement in the school library Web pages/sites; differences in aims, purposes, design, organization, and content of school library Web pages/sites between 1996 and 1999; and new ways of organizing links and any evidence of a developing consensus about the best way(s) of organizing links for effective use. The research has implications for those who are planning a Web page/site for their school library/media center; it provides information about what other school libraries/media centers have done and suggests some pitfalls that might be avoided. It also suggests areas for further study, notably the possible development of a model that might be used for the evaluation of school library Web sites. (Contains 42 references.) (MES)

But in East Asia a new system has emerged that challenges the economic principles the West extols. In fact, as James Fallows vividly demonstrates, the theories we embrace to explain how nations rise and fall have prevented us from seeing the true nature of this new system and its enormous impact on us." "Skillfully blending history with on-the-ground reportage and astute analysis, Fallows reveals how political goals and historical experience have shaped Japan's economic rise and placed it at the heart of the Asian system. He shows how the explosive growth of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore has been fueled by Japanese investment; why Burma, the Philippines, and Vietnam have been largely isolated from the region's progress; and why Korea, Taiwan, and "Greater China" are the strongest contenders for future economic dominance." "Extraordinary in depth and scope, Looking At the Sun provides the first clear picture of the Asian rise and the magnitude of its challenge to the Western world."--Jacket\n

description1819=Investing Guide at Deep Blue Group Publications LLC Osaka, Japan’s third-biggest metropolis, plans to sell the city’s 81-year-old subway operator in an initial public offering to lure private investment after ceding ground to Tokyo. Osaka plans to privatize the operations, which could be valued at more than 600 billion yen ($5.9 billion), in the next few years as part of efforts to become a global metropolis, prefectural Governor Ichiro Matsui said in an April 8 interview. It may also weigh a sale to private investors, he said. Local governments in Osaka prefecture, near the ancient capital of Kyoto and home to electronics makers Panasonic Corp. and Sharp Corp., are stepping up sales of public assets to cut debt. Osaka is privatizing state-run companies and talking to potential investors including Caesars Entertainment Corp. on a planned $4.9 billion casino resort as it seeks to overcome a declining population. “I am ready for the subway sale any time,” said Matsui, 50, who also is secretary-general of the Japan Restoration Party. “Osaka city assembly members should all have a sense of urgency to move this economic stimulus forward, as Osaka needs to bring in economic revival.” A proposal to privatize the metro, which carries 2.24 million passengers daily, was submitted to the city assembly in February 2013, according to documents posted on the Osaka government’s website. The proposal, which is under discussion, would have Osaka transfer the subway operations to a separate government-owned entity and then fully privatize them, the documents show. It didn’t elaborate on the sale method or valuation. Shrinking Population The Osaka subway, which started operations in 1933, has nine lines running in the city and totaling 138 kilometers (86 miles). The privatization proposal will need endorsement by two-thirds of the assembly to be passed. Osaka prefecture’s economic output dropped 6.2 percent to 36.6 trillion yen in the year through March 2012 from a decade earlier, according to the latest data compiled by the Cabinet Office. That compares with a 0.4 percent decline in Tokyo’s output, to 92.4 trillion yen. The population of Osaka prefecture fell to 8.85 million as of March 1, down 0.1 percent from a year earlier. It’s forecast to shrink another 5 percent by 2025, according to a report compiled last year by the National Institute of Population & Social Security Research. Tokyo’s population, which rose 0.5 percent to 13.3 million in the year to March 1, is projected to decrease to 13.2 million by 2025. “Osaka’s economic revival is vital to helping Japan avert a default or economic crisis, as Tokyo’s growth alone won’t be enough to bring momentum to the country’s overall economy,” said Matsui. “Other prefectures should follow suit.” Selling Assets Osaka joins the nation’s capital in seeking to sell transportation infrastructure. The Tokyo metropolitan government has been studying a sale of its 46.6 stake in the city’s subway operator, Governor Yoichi Masuzoe said March 19. Matsui said in January his government has been holding talks with global casino operators including Caesars Entertainment, Genting Singapore Plc and MGM Resorts International on a plan to build a resort complex in the Osaka Bay area that would cost at least 500 billion yen. In February, Matsui said the prefectural government plans to sell Osaka Prefectural Urban Development Co., a commuter rail operator, to Nankai Electric Railway Co. for 75 billion yen. State-owned New Kansai International Airport Co. is working with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. to sell rights to operate two of Japan’s biggest airports, people familiar with the situation said last month. “By turning to a small government from a big one, Osaka is shifting to companies those things that can be left to the private sector,” Matsui said. “The casino-resort project, airport privatization and subway sale have great potential to lure private money into Osaka and its surrounding areas.” The above article is a repost from Bloomberg

description1815=This article is from Journal of Gynecologic Oncology , volume 22 . Abstract Objective\: Synchronous occurrence of endometrial and ovarian tumors is uncommon, and they affect less than 10% of women with endometrial or ovarian cancers. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological and clinical factors; and survival outcomes of women with these cancers. Methods\: This is a retrospective cohort study in a large tertiary institution in Singapore. The sample consists of women with endometrial and epithelial ovarian cancers followed up over a period of 10 years from 2000 to 2009. The epidemiological and clinical factors include age at diagnosis, histology types, grade and stage of disease. Results\: A total of 75 patients with synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancers were identified. However, only 46 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median follow-up was 74 months. The incidence rate for synchronous cancer is 8.7% of all epithelial ovarian cancers and 4.9% of all endometrial cancers diagnosed over this time frame. Mean age at diagnosis was 47.3 years old. The most common presenting symptom was abnormal uterine bleeding (36.9%) and 73.9% had endometrioid histology for both endometrial and ovarian cancers. The majority of the women (78%) presented were at early stages of 1 and 2. There were 6 (13.6%) cases of recurrence and the 5 year cumulative survival rate was at 84%. Conclusion\: In our cohort, we found that majority of women afflicted with synchronous cancer of the endometrium and ovary were younger at age of diagnosis, had early stage of cancer and good survival.

description1813=Jakarta. New York and London remain the world’s most global cities, while select emerging-market cities led by Jakarta, Manila and Addis Ababa strengthened their ability to challenge global leaders in the next 10 to 20 years, according to this year’s Global Cities Index issued by management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. The 2014 edition of the Global Cities Index also includes the Emerging Cities Outlook 2014, a forward-looking measurement of emerging cities with the potential to improve their global standing in the next few decades. Jakarta ranked first among 35 cities most likely to move up the rankings. John Kurtz, A.T. Kearney’s head of Asia Pacific and president director of A.T. Kearney Indonesia, explained that “the study now confirms what so many Jakarta residents know; the city has its share of challenges but has become truly global in a variety of ways and is now attracting talent from both the Indonesian and global business and cultural communities. Recent leadership by Governor Joko Widodo and Deputy Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama has lent further credibility and optimism to the picture and it is very clear that Jakarta is on the rise.” The Jakarta governor is running for president this year and polls suggest he will emerge victorious, being more popular than other serious contenders like the Great Indonesia Movement Party’s (Gerindra) Prabowo Subianto and the Golkar Party’s Aburizal Bakrie. Joko’s party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), appears to have won Wednesday’s legislative election convincingly, although not by as big a margin as some expected. The Global Cities Index, conducted every two years since 2008, measures global engagement for 84 cities on every continent, examining how globally engaged each city is across 26 metrics in five dimensions — business activity, human capital, information exchange, cultural experience and political engagement. This provides a holistic look at what differentiates cities in generating, attracting and retaining global capital, people and ideas. Mike Hales, A.T. Kearney partner and study co-leader, said that “corporate executives use the information in the Global Cities Index to help them choose the most suitable locations for regional headquarters, research centers and operation hubs. City mayors and urban economic development planners will find insights to inform their improvement plans and investment decisions to better compete in the global economy and against other global cities.” The Emerging Cities Outlook measures the likelihood that a city will improve its global standing over the next 10 to 20 years. It focuses on the leading indicators of business activity, human capital and innovation. According to Andres Mendoza Pena, A.T. Kearney principal and co-author of the report, “as physical distances become less relevant and global competition intensifies, cities in low- and middle-income countries will increasingly jockey for position with one another and with cities in higher-income countries.” Jakarta’s strong showing on the ECO signals that select cities in numerous countries throughout eastern Asia are laying solid groundwork to become global cities and eventually raise their ranking in the Global Cities Index. Kurtz said that Jakarta was the most likely city worldwide to advance its global position, driven by significant increases across the leading indicators. In 2014, Jakarta showed the greatest improvement in information exchange. The city is an increasingly conducive setting for doing business, anchored by a high GDP growth rate. Human capital, especially in the health care evolution metric, presents a major opportunity for Jakarta to exploit, he said. In order to capitalize on this potential, according to Kurtz, Jakarta must provide greater transparency in doing business, revamp the regulations in setting up businesses, and be more open to the new global business environment. Tangible examples that would favorably impact Jakarta could include acceleration of MRT development, better public transportation to support workers to commute between Jakarta and satellite cities, development of the new port to increase throughput of export and import, as well as integration of the infrastructure with central business districts and industrial parks. Jakarta would also need to improve the presence of international education, an aspect where it still lags behind other cities. Consistent with previous editions of the Global Cities Index, New York, London, Paris and Tokyo lead the ranking. Among the top 20 cities, seven are in the Asia-Pacific region (Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore, Seoul, Sydney and Shanghai), seven are in Europe (London, Paris, Brussels, Madrid, Vienna, Moscow and Berlin), and six are in the Americas (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Toronto and Buenos Aires).

description1809=In recent years, concern in several Southeast Asian nations about the deterioration of values within their societies has resulted in renewed efforts to teach values by means of special courses in the schools. This paper compares the current programs of values education in four of the nations\: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Phillipines, and Singapore. The comparison centers on the motives behind efforts to improve values education, types of values emphasized, strategies for promoting the values, and problems encountered in such educational programs. Historical and statistical data on each of the four countries provide a setting within which official statements concerning moral education programs' particular topics undergo scrutiny.

description1804=When there were only black and white market of medicines , now comes the emergence of gray market where illicit profiteers are ostensibly marketing competitive brands without regulatory approval. These products are seldom “counterfeit” per se, but are very often substandard. Since it can either be safe or hazardous, extra careful consumers are cautious of purchasing their medicines from these stores. However, there is knowing when you will be dealing with gray market. These kinds of markets are illegal, yet are often permitted because of the lack of other resources. Those who mostly profit from products of gray market are the poor and less fortunate since they are offering cheaper medicines. In the case reported by Jakarta Post in Indonesia shows how a small independent pharmacy sets up a shop, got a license with a state board of pharmacy and then signs a contract with a primary wholesaler. The contract between the wholesaler and store states that they are to sell the medicines directly to consumer. However, this reported pharmacy sold some of their products to other retailers, who also have connection working in a fraudulent manufacturing company. Moreover, the authorities are even more concerned of the fact that these medicines can be sold in the gray market for five to six times within the day, making it more improbable to catch the culprit. The Peterson Group , a non-profit organization campaigning against counterfeit medicines stated that the existence of gray market could be the main reason why fraud medicines exist . Yet, with the demand, the authorities cannot fully obliterate the illegal activities. Gray pharmaceutical companies often take advantage of legal gaps, unwillingness to enforce existing laws and flexibility of operations. Criminals and terrorist organizations are known to seek out the weakest link among local jurisdictions. As capacity increases in one region, illicit syndicates and terrorists move on to expose the loopholes in the next. A survey was generated where hundreds of comments from respondents who have a lot of complaints against their governments were conducted. These respondents feel unsupported by regulatory agencies that have not stepped in to control the gray market, betrayed by some pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers who they presume may have sold medications in short supply to gray market vendors, perplexed regarding how gray market vendors know about pending drug shortages before hospitals do, outraged by the price gouging that accompanies the sale of these vital medications, and frustrated by the wasted time spent on unsolicited communications (telephone calls, emails, faxes) from gray market vendors.

description1786=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is created in an aim to integrate Intellectual Property (IP) enforcement standards that go beyond current international law, shifting the discussion to a democratic multilateral form. In this agreement, the United States has vowed to hand over their increased responsibility on spearheading related global organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to secret regional sectors. The member countries are given the initiative to act on their own accord against infringement including piracy on security technologies. Currently, Australia, Canada and EU with the other 27 member states, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Switzerland and the United States are negotiating ACTA. With the ambiguity of ACTA’s scope and delimitations, the agreement is being pressured by various related organizations. The Peterson Group , a non-profit organization campaigning against proliferation of fraudulent drugs , has enumerated some of the issues faced by this multilateral agreement\: 1. It doesn’t speak its name The name of treaty is misleading. When it acts as an anti-counterfeiting agreement between countries, it does not cover overall counterfeiting especially on medicines.   One of the main challenges of counterfeiting is limited to trademark violations where there is a deliberate attempt to deceive. ACTA blurs its objectives on this issue. Only the United States aims to exclude patents from the entire scope of agreement. UK and Japan would want to include theirs. ACTA is a non-sectoral agreement, and does not specifically address counterfeit medicines. It vaguely mentions obliterating drug counterfeiting as one of its agenda, much to the complaints of health professionals. Negotiators argue that it will work to address the problem of counterfeit drugs by “establishing international standards for trademark enforcement.” Negotiators rejected the proposal to remove medicines from the scope of the agreement because “removing pharmaceuticals would result in lower sectoral enforcement standards.” 2. ACTA bypasses Judiciary system In a review of its exclusions, ACTA undermines the judiciary system of each state by allowing extra-legal processes. It permits its officials to seize and destroy any suspected drug counterfeiting processes without informing the owner or undergoing proper legal process. A concrete example is depicted when ACTA raided without warning a legitimate drug experimentation laboratory in West Jakarta, confiscating and destroying hundreds and thousand dollars-worth of tools and equipment. It was later found out that the lab is being used by a local pharmaceutical company to the enhancement of alternative medicine and integration of medical and conventional treatments.

description1777=This article is from Cancer Management and Research , volume 6 . Abstract Regorafenib is a broad-spectrum oral multikinase inhibitor that targets several angiogenic, oncogenic, and stromal receptor tyrosine kinases that support the tumor microenvironment. Results from the pivotal Phase III Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Treated with Regorafenib or Placebo After Failure of Standard Therapy (CORRECT) trial showed that the addition of regorafenib to best supportive care resulted in a significant improvement in median overall survival and progression-free survival compared with placebo plus best supportive care in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) following all available approved therapies. Thus, regorafenib is the first oral multikinase inhibitor indicated for mCRC; it currently has approval in the USA, EU, Japan, Canada, and Singapore for the treatment of mCRC patients who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, and, if the tumor is KRAS wild-type, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy. In this review, we highlight regorafenib’s mechanism of action, present key efficacy data from the CORRECT trial, and discuss how to proactively manage common adverse events (eg, hand-foot skin reaction, hypertension, oral mucositis, diarrhea, and fatigue) experienced by patients receiving regorafenib. Increased awareness of potential adverse events associated with regorafenib and the implementation of proactive strategies to prevent, monitor, and manage these events early in the course of treatment will be instrumental in ensuring optimal patient management and continuation of regorafenib therapy.

description1771=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: In Asia, up to 25% of breast cancer patients present with distant metastases at diagnosis. Given the heterogeneous survival probabilities of de novo metastatic breast cancer, individual outcome prediction is challenging. The aim of the study is to identify existing prognostic models for patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer and validate them in Asia. Materials and Methods\: We performed a systematic review to identify prediction models for metastatic breast cancer. Models were validated in 642 women with de novo metastatic breast cancer registered between 2000 and 2010 in the Singapore Malaysia Hospital Based Breast Cancer Registry. Survival curves for low, intermediate and high-risk groups according to each prognostic score were compared by log-rank test and discrimination of the models was assessed by concordance statistic (C-statistic). Results\: We identified 16 prediction models, seven of which were for patients with brain metastases only. Performance status, estrogen receptor status, metastatic site(s) and disease-free interval were the most common predictors. We were able to validate nine prediction models. The capacity of the models to discriminate between poor and good survivors varied from poor to fair with C-statistics ranging from 0.50 (95% CI, 0.48–0.53) to 0.63 (95% CI, 0.60–0.66). Conclusion\: The discriminatory performance of existing prediction models for de novo metastatic breast cancer in Asia is modest. Development of an Asian-specific prediction model is needed to improve prognostication and guide decision making.

description1763=Har ar nagra tecken pa en eventuell oarlig anstalld\: 1. Vill aldrig ta en semester. Det finns en anledning, och det ar inte workaholism. Bokforare som upptrader daligt for att kunna avlyssna telefonsamtal och korrespondens. Och for chefen som riflar genom sitt skrivbord for att hitta nagot nar de ar ute av kontoret - det skulle vara outhardligt, forstas\! 2. Har alltid mer arbete att gora an det kan bli klart under normal arbetstid Sa mycket faktum att de maste stanna efter alla andra gar hem. Eller om du later dem, tycker de om att ta jobbet hem. Det har kanske inte ar den lojalitet du forvantar dig\: oovervakat arbete gor att bokforaren kan manipulera poster med mindre chans att upptacka. 3. En tatletal. Gillar att papeka inkompetens hos andra anstallda . Pekande fingrar hos andra satter en alibi pa plats, om du upptacker nagot som ar felaktigt. Dan samlar inte in alla sina konton. Insattningen verkade for liten? (Det ar Dan). Sharon hanger pa kontoret nar hon inte hor hemma dar. Det saknas porto? (Kan vara Sharon) Linda ar oorganiserad. Varfor ar detta brev felaktigt? (Linda ar slarvig) Kanske bokforaren deponerade en del av Dans insattning pa eget konto och tog ocksa ut portot. Lindas brev kan vara felaktigt eftersom bokforaren inte ville ha en revisor att se det. 4. Volontarer att ta hand om detaljer som ska hanteras av cheferna - hjalp genom att samla in signaturkort nar du till exempel oppnar ett nytt bankkonto. Ju mer information bokhandlaren hanterar, desto mer mojlighet till klibbiga fingrar, och desto lattare ar det att tacka upp saker. 5. Gillar att hamta posten, aven om det ar mer meningsfullt for en lagre anstalld att ta upp den uppgiften. Posten ar bade frestande och skrammande for anstallda som stjal. Kontroller kommer i posten. Sa gor ovantade meddelanden som kan leda dig till deras stold. 6. Atgarder som bokforingsuppgifter ar lika svara som hjarnkirurgi och dubbelt sa komplicerat. Jag dumpar nagon bokhallare som inte kan forklara saker for mig i termer jag kan forsta. Det gar dubbelt for revisorer som svarar pa mina nosiga fragor genom att gora brott. - Hon verkar som om hon inte TRUSTER mig\! - Ja. Nar de skuldar reser du, kolla ryggen. 7. Berattar lite fibr, kanske inte relaterat till bokforing Lilla logner berattar stora historier om manniskors karaktar. 8. Verkar kanna att foretaget ar skyldigt i nagot; Som om han har gjort mer an vad som kan forvantas av nagon rimlig person Faktum ar att de flesta anstallda som tar saker verkligen tror att foretaget ar skyldigt for dem. De kan borja med ... ja, lana ... da rattfardiga att gora det till en stold genom att bestamma att du inte betalar dem tillrackligt. 9. Skriver ut i exakta, stada brev, men kan inte tyckas hitta saker nar du fragar; Blandar vissa saker i roriga lilla hogar. A ha\! Detta ar ett riktigt bra tips. Manniskors vanor ar vanligtvis inte sa schizo - de ar antingen konsekvent roriga eller tvangsmassigt stada. Revisorer faller oftast in i stada kategorin. Om du har en som ar snygg och rorig pa samma gang, borjar du kolla pa allt som ser ut som rorigt. 10.

description1761=The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is the largest and most ambitious study undertaken by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. Forty-five countries collected data in more than 30 languages. Five grade levels were tested in the two subject areas, so that more than half a million students were tested around the world. This report addresses middle-school mathematics achievement (grades seven and eight) in six content areas\: (1) fractions and number sense; (2) measurement; (3) proportionality; (4) data representation, analysis, and probability; (5) geometry; and (6) algebra. Results cover 41 countries with complete data collection. Singapore was the top-performing country at both grade levels, with Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong also performing very well. There were large differences in average achievement between top performers and bottom performing nations. Gender differences in mathematics achievement were small or nearly nonexistent in most countries, but when they did appear, they favored boys. In nearly every country there was a strong positive relationship between student enjoyment of mathematics and higher achievement. Home factors were strongly related to mathematics achievement in every participating country, but relationships between instructional variables and achievement were less clear. In every country, the pattern was for the eighth grade student whose parents had more education to also have higher achievement in mathematics. The amount of television viewing was negatively associated with mathematics achievement. The document's introduction provides information on each country's characteristics including demographics, public expenditures on education, organization of educational system. Chapters address\: (1) International Student Achievement in Mathematics; (2) Average Achievement; (3) Performance on Items within Each Mathematics Content Area; (4) Students Backgrounds and Attitudes towards Mathematics; and (5) Teachers and Instruction. Appendixes include\: Overview of TIMSS Procedures; Test-Curriculum Matching Analysis; Selected Mathematics Achievement Eighth-Grade Results for the Philippines, Denmark, Sweden, and German-Speaking Switzerland; and Percentiles and Standard Deviations of Mathematics Achievement.

description1754=This article is from International Journal of Biomedical Science \: IJBS , volume 3 . Abstract EMRSA-15 (ST22-MRSA-IV) is rapidly replacing the endemic ST239 health care-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clone in Singapore. A one-year single-centre cohort study of inpatients with MRSA bacteremia was performed to determine if bacteremia caused by EMRSA-15 was associated with worse outcomes compared to bacteremia caused by the endemic ST239 strain. Strains were identified by antibiotypes, and subsequent validation was performed on a selected sample of MRSA strains via pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec typing. Two hundred and twenty-eight patients with MRSA bacteremia were studied; Seventy-three were infected with EMRSA-15. EMRSA-15 and ST239-infected patients were similar regarding gender, frequencies of most co-morbidities, and risk factors for adverse outcomes. Similar numbers of EMRSA-15-infected and ST239-infected patients died (24.7% vs 27.1%, P\=0.70) or developed complicated infections (41.1% vs 40.0%, P\=0.88). After multivariate analysis, EMRSA-15 as a cause of bacteremia was not significantly associated with either death or development of complicated infections, although inappropriate therapy (5.45-fold, P
description1753=How can mathematics education foster the skills that are appropriate for innovative societies? Mathematics education is heavily emphasised worldwide, nevertheless it is still considered to be a stumbling block for many students. While there is almost a consensus that mathematics problems appropriate for the 21st century should be complex, unfamiliar and nonroutine CUN, most of the textbooks still mainly include routine problems based on the application of readymade algorithms. The time has come to introduce innovative instructional methods in order to enhance mathematics education and students’ ability to solve CUN tasks. Metacognitive pedagogies can play a key role in this. These pedagogies explicitly train students to “think about their thinking” during learning. They can be used to improve not just academic achievement content knowledge and understanding, the ability to handle unfamiliar problems etc. but also affective outcomes such as reduced anxiety or improved motivation. This strong relationship between metacognition and schooling outcomes has implications for the education community and policy makers. This book is designed to assist practitioners, curriculum developers and policy makers alike in preparing today’s students for tomorrow’s world.\nDescription based upon print version of record\nForeword; Acknowledgements; Table of contents; Acronyms and abbreviations; Executive summary; Introduction; Mathematics education and problem-solving skills in innovative societies; Complex, unfamiliar and non-routine problem solving; Mathematical reasoning; Mathematical creativity, divergent thinking and posing problems; Mathematical communication; Conclusion; References; What is metacognition?; What is the difference between cognition and metacognition?; Models of metacognition; General versus domain-specific metacognition; How does metacognition develop with age?\nHow does metacognition affect learning and achievement?Conclusion; References; Metacognitive pedagogies; Can metacognition be taught?; What is the role of co-operative learning?; Is explicit practice necessary?; Metacognitive pedagogies\: how, when and for whom?; Conclusion; References; Metacognitive pedagogies in mathematics education; Polya's heuristics for solving maths problems; Schoenfeld's metacognitive instructional model; IMPROVE model; Verschaffel's model of metacognitive instruction for upper elementary school maths; Singapore model of mathematics problem solving\nComparing the metacognitive modelsConclusion; References; The effects of metacognitive instruction on achievement; The impact of metacognitive programmes on problem solving across age groups; Immediate, delayed and lasting effects of metacognitive instruction; What conditions work best for metacognitive instructional models?; Conclusion; References; The effects of metacognitive pedagogies on social and emotional skills; Can social-emotional skills be taught?; Metacognitive pedagogies and their effects on social-emotional competencies\nType I studies\: the effects of achievement-focused interventionsType II studies\: using metacognitive pedagogies to promote social-emotional competencies; Type III studies\: the combined approach; Conclusion; References; Combining technology and metacognitive processes to promote learning; Combining domain-specific mathematics software with metacognitive instruction; E-learning supported by metacognitive instruction; Asynchronous learning networks supported by metacognitive instruction; Mobile learning in mathematics; Intelligent tutoring software; Mathematics e-books; Conclusion; References\nMetacognitive programmes for teacher trainingHow do teachers apply metacognitive processes in their classrooms?; Implementing metacognitive pedagogies in professional development programmes; The effects of metacognitive pedagogies on pre-service teachers; Conclusion; References; Looking backwards\: Summary and conclusion; References\nHow can mathematics education foster the skills that are appropriate for innovative societies?

description1749=This article is from Asia Pacific Allergy , volume 3 . Abstract Background\: Latex allergy and its clinical presentation are rising in prevalence across the globe, especially amongst patients with spina bifida (SB). While studies have been well-established in Europe and America, data from Asia are limited. Objective\: The aim of this study is to investigate the scenario in Singapore. Methods\: 35 subjects with SB, aged 5 to 32 years answered a questionnaire and underwent skin prick test (SPT) using a latex solution, 3 common house dust mites and 3 commonly cross-reacting food allergens (banana, kiwi and avocado). We also noted the relation between latex sensitization with atopy and doctor-diagnosed allergy. The prevalence of cross-reactivity with fruits was also studied. Results\: Sensitization to latex (i.e. a positive SPT) was found in 16 (46%, 95% confidence interval 29%-63%) of the subjects. Only 5 (31%) of the subjects who were sensitized to latex had clinical manifestations. Atopy (i.e. positive SPT to house dust mites) was present in 23 (66%) of the subjects and 13 (57%) of them was also sensitized to latex. There was a positive trend between latex sensitization and atopy (81.2% vs. 52.6%, p \= 0.076), as well as latex sensitization with those having both atopy and doctor-diagnosed allergy (i.e. asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, drug allergy) (93.8% vs. 63.2%, p \= 0.032). Only 6 (38%) subjects had allergy to the food allergens tested. Conclusion\: Almost half of the SB patients in Singapore are sensitized to latex. This number is comparable to that in Europe and America. Positive trend between latex sensitization and those with both atopy and doctor-diagnosed allergy (p \= 0.032) is suggestive of a possible cause-effect relationship.

description1746=The report on the status of the Indonesian and Malay languages in Australia documents the history of those languages in Australian education, within selected communities, in international trade, and among high school students. The first chapter gives a brief history of the Indonesian and Malay languages and comments on their place in the life of contemporary Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore. Chapters 2-5 detail its teaching and use in Australia's educational system, focusing on significant influences and events in three periods\: 1955-70, its introduction during a period of crisis in the teaching of languages other than English; 1970-86, a period of retrenchment in Australian education and business and turmoil in Indonesia; and 1986-92, characterized by heightened awareness of the value of languages other than English. Chapter 6 describes language use patterns in the Indonesian community of the Sydney metropolitan area, and chapter 7 summarizes a survey of Australian companies regarding their current and projected need for Indonesian/Malay language and cultural skills. The final chapter reports on a survey of Australian year 11 students studying these two languages. A series of recommendations for the teaching of Indonesian and Malay in Australia is also presented. Bibliographies of references and instructional resources and a language attitude questionnaire are appended. (MSE)

description1739=Written commentary on Revelation, Tagalog version, by Dr. Bob Utley, retired Professor of Hermeneutics (Bible Interpretation). This is one of the most difficult books to interpret. We must be careful not to be dogmatic in our interpretation because godly people throughout history have disagreed on its meaning. It is a uniquely Jewish literary genre, apocalyptic, which was often used in tension-filled times to express the conviction that God was in control of history and would bring deliverance to His people. The author is believed to be the Apostle John. The setting was persecution caused by the separation of the Christian church from the legal protection Rome accorded to Judaism. Revelation was written to show God's sovereignty in history and the promise of the culmination of all things in Him. Christians are to remain faithful even amidst persecution, always remembering the blessed hope. Part of the "You Can Understand the Bible" TM series.

description1728=International Financial Corporation Fraud Regulatory Commission Stress is a fact of modern life\: a direct result of more technology and less time. Before the computer, the mobile phone, the instant access to information and rapid exchange of emails, life was slower and more predictable. So how do we manage in this always-on world we’re living in, what strategies should we adopt to make sure that far from drowning under the pressure we’re able to stay on top of things and actually increase our productivity? Here are a few hints to send those stress levels plummeting and your production levels soaring. 1. Get organised A simple but highly effective start to the de-stressing process . Begin every day with a clear desk, literally and mentally. Set out your objectives for the day and list them. Everyone loves ticking off items, and it's a really positive thing to do. Be realistic with your objectives and identify the order of priority. Bear in mind that the unexpected will always happen, and that your day will be peppered with interruptions. And if you just can't find time for one of today's non-priority items, it can go to the top of tomorrow's list. 2. Plan ahead You may be starting each day with a 'to do' list, but you also need to look further ahead. Identify events, projects and tasks which are coming up and be sure to make space in your schedule for them. And don't just do it once. Check and update your calendar regularly - it's a good idea to schedule your own 'diary meeting' at the same time every week. 3. Don't take on too much It's the easiest thing in the world to agree to just one more little task. Be careful – by mid-morning, those little tasks can quite easily turn into a mountain of work. You have to find a way to say 'no'. No need to be abrupt – try something along the lines of 'I'd love to help you out but I have a backlog building up. If I can get through enough work, I'll give you a shout later and see what I can do to help'. You're giving a firm 'no' but showing a willingness to assist others once your personal responsibilities are fulfilled. If a manager is trying to pile work on you, show your work list and ask whether he or she would like to change the priorities in order to accommodate this new task. This puts the onus back on the manager and explains why you might not be able to deliver on time. 4. Take time out If work is getting on top of you, develop the discipline to turn away from your work or screen and just breathe deeply for a few seconds. The 'square breathing' technique is a great way of self-calming – just Google it to learn more about the technique. Then get up, take a brief walk to the kitchen or coffee machine, just to give yourself a change of environment. Don't leave it long enough to get out of work mode – but a few seconds to recentre yourself can really make a difference here. 5. Cut down your interruptions You can't do much about phone calls, other than not answer them. Obviously, you need to take important calls, but if a call appears to be something that can wait, let voicemail do what it was designed to do. Follow the same procedure with emails and internal messages – if they need a swift response, get on with it. If not, leave them for a while. It's a good idea to schedule a number of periods during the day when you can respond to emails and calls.

description1717=This article is from BMC Women's Health , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: A vast amount of literature describes the incidence of fracture as a risk for recurrent osteoporotic fractures in western and Asian countries. Osteoporosis evaluation and treatment after a low-trauma fracture, however, has not been well characterized in postmenopausal women in Asia. The purpose of this study was to characterize patient and health system characteristics associated with the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis among postmenopausal women hospitalized with a fragility fracture in Asia. Methods\: Patient surveys and medical charts of postmenopausal women (N\=1,122) discharged after a fragility hip fracture from treatment centers in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand between July 1, 2006 and June 30, 2007 were reviewed for bone mineral density (BMD) measurement, osteoporosis diagnosis, and osteoporosis treatment. Results\: The mean (SD) age was 72.9 (11.5) years. A BMD measurement was reported by 28.2% of patients, 51.5% were informed that they had osteoporosis, and 33.0% received prescription medications for osteoporosis in the 6 months after discharge. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, prior history of fracture decreased the odds of a BMD measurement (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.88). Having a BMD measurement increased the odds of osteoporosis diagnosis (OR 10.1, 95% CI 6.36-16.0), as did having health insurance (OR 4.95, 95% CI 1.51-16.21 for private insurance with partial self-payment relative to 100% self-payment). A history of fracture was not independently associated with an osteoporosis diagnosis (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56-1.15). Younger age reduced the odds of receiving medication for osteoporosis (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.96 relative to age ≥65), while having a BMD measurement increased the odds (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.23-2.61). Conclusions\: Osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment in Asian countries were driven by BMD measurement but not by fracture history. Future efforts should emphasize education of general practitioners and patients about the importance of fracture.

description1709=The collection consists of correspondence, documents, printed materials, unpublished manuscripts, and photographs. The bulk of the sections consists of materials pertaining to Buky's immigration. These materials include applications, correspondence with German and Japanese authorities, clippings from the Shanghai newspapers, as well as personal correspondence and a large number of biographical essays. These memoirs shed light on Buky’s experience in pre-war war Germany, his imprisonment in Dachau, immigration to Shanghai, and life in the United States. Other materials dealing with immigration and the war period include materials regarding Herta and Herbert Buky’s restitution cases. These include correspondence, forms, and legal documents. Additionally, there are two audio tapes of Oral History narrated by Herbert Buky. Furthermore, there is personal correspondence of Herbert Buky as well as a small amount of correspondence from his grandparents, photographs of Herbert Buky and other members of the Buky family, printed materials, such as clippings, brochures, and newsletters, and some genealogical materials. Other correspondence includes correspondence with lawyers and American and German authorities regarding restitution and pension. Additional personal materials include education and travel documents, daybooks, and photographs of Herbert Buky as well as other members of the Buky family. There are very few materials dealing with Herbert Buky’s professional activities. Herbert Buky was born in 1901 in Beuthen, Germany, (now Bythom, Poland). He received his initial education in Beuthen before attending universities in Breslau, Heidelberg, Jena and Leipzig, studying economics and journalism. Herbert Buky worked for a number of newspapers including Allgemeine Lokalanzeiger Beuthen, Israelitisches Familienblatt, Juedische Rundschau, CV Zeitung, Juedische Allgemeine Zeitung Berlin, and Juedische Zeitung Breslau. In 1936 he founded a communal paper-Juedisches Gemeindeblatt fuer Oberschlesien (Gleiwitz, Beuthen, Hindenburg) and served as its editor and publisher until it was shut down in 1939. In 1939 Herbert Buky was imprisoned in Buchenwald. Upon his release the same year, he and his wife Herta left for Shanghai via Gibraltar, India, Singapore, Manila, Hong Kong. In Shanghai he was involved in the Jewish cultural life and became a singer. In 1947 Herbert Buky and his wife immigrated to the United States and settled in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania where he worked as a laboratory assistant at the Western Pennsylvania hospital. Herbert Buky died in 1990.

description1703=This article is from Genome Biology and Evolution , volume 6 . Abstract The Candida parapsilosis species complex comprises a group of emerging human pathogens of varying virulence. This complex was recently subdivided into three different species\: C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C. metapsilosis, and C. orthopsilosis. Within the latter, at least two clearly distinct subspecies seem to be present among clinical isolates (Type 1 and Type 2). To gain insight into the genomic differences between these subspecies, we undertook the sequencing of a clinical isolate classified as Type 1 and compared it with the available sequence of a Type 2 clinical strain. Unexpectedly, the analysis of the newly sequenced strain revealed a highly heterozygous genome, which we show to be the consequence of a hybridization event between both identified subspecies. This implicitly suggests that C. orthopsilosis is able to mate, a so-far unanswered question. The resulting hybrid shows a chimeric genome that maintains a similar gene dosage from both parental lineages and displays ongoing loss of heterozygosity. Several of the differences found between the gene content in both strains relate to virulent-related families, with the hybrid strain presenting a higher copy number of genes coding for efflux pumps or secreted lipases. Remarkably, two clinical strains isolated from distant geographical locations (Texas and Singapore) are descendants of the same hybrid line, raising the intriguing possibility of a relationship between the hybridization event and the global spread of a virulent clone.
description1702=This article is from Parasite , volume 21 . Abstract Haemoproteus ilanpapernai Karadjian and Landau n. sp. from the Spotted Wood Owl, Strix seloputo, in Singapore is described from material from Ilan Paperna’s collection of slides. The species was previously identified as Haemoproteus syrnii (Mayer, 1910). However, comparisons between the material from Strix seloputo and our own material from Strix aluco, the type host of H. syrnii, revealed morphological and molecular differences. H. ilanpapernai n. sp. differs morphologically from H. syrnii by the much smaller size of the gametocytes, the different position of the mature gametocytes in the erythrocyte (apical, subapical, or lateral in H. ilanpapernai vs. always lateral in H. syrnii), the effect on the erythrocyte nucleus (frequently tilted in H. ilanpapernai but not displaced laterally vs. straight and displaced laterally in H. syrnii) and characters of the pigment (aggregated in the gametocytes of H. ilanpapernai vs. dispersed in H. syrnii). A molecular analysis showed that the two species differ by 2.9% at the cyt b and 3.1% at the COI genes.

description8=This article is from BMC Pediatrics , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: Continuous surveillance for intussusception (IS) is important for monitoring the safety of second-generation rotavirus vaccines. The present study aimed to assess the incidence of IS in Singaporean children aged < 2 years. Methods\: This was a prospective, hospital-based, multi-center surveillance conducted in seven hospitals - two public hospitals and five private medical centers between May 2002 and June 2010 in Singapore. Diagnosis of IS (definite, probable, possible, suspected) was based on the case definition developed by the Brighton Collaboration. Children < 2 years of age who were diagnosed with IS were enrolled in this study. Incidence of IS was calculated per 100,000 child-year with its 95% confidence interval. Results\: Of the 178 children enrolled, 167 children with definite IS cases were considered for final analyses; 11 were excluded (six diagnosed as probable IS and four diagnosed as suspected IS; one child’s parents withdrew consent). Mean age of children with definite IS was 11.6 ± 6 months; 67.7% were males. The overall incidence of IS was 28.9 (95% CI\: 23.0–34.8) and 26.1 (95% CI\: 22.2–30.0) per 100,000 child-year in children < 1 year and < 2 years of age, respectively. The majority of IS cases (20 [12.0%]) were reported in children aged 6 months. Most children (98.2% [164/167]) recovered, two (1.2%) children recovered with sequelae and one (0.6%) child died of septic shock. Conclusions\: The incidence of IS remained low and stable in Singaporean children aged < 2 years during the study period (May 2002 to June 2010). Trial registration\: NCT01177839

description1694=The computer-supported Project Work classroom learning environment discussed in this paper represents a paradigm shift from teacher-centered to student-centered teaching and learning in Singapore schools. Besides the face-to-face weekly lessons in existing Project Work classrooms, the students engaged in computer-supported online forum discussions. Two hundred and sixty students and 26 teachers from seven high schools participated in this study. Their perceptions of this new learning environment were assessed using a modified version of the Web-based Learning Environment Instrument (WEBLEI). In addition, the instrument was also validated. The WEBLEI exhibited satisfactory internal consistency reliability and discriminant validity. Comparing the actual and preferred perceptions of the students and teachers revealed that there were differences between the actual and preferred perceptions for both students and teachers. With these in mind, the implications for using technology to support the face-to-face teaching and learning in Project Work classrooms are discussed in this paper. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)
description1693=Horace Greeley was historically correct when he admonished the early pioneers to "Go West\!" While historically insightful he was geographically limited. The West now extends beyond the borders and across the vast Pacific Ocean to the entire Pacific Rim. Characteristically, these countries are growing economically, politically, and socially with major world-wide influence. While this leadership and evolving dominance was not based on these countries' leisure influence, the rich history, culture and the melding of technological advances in the leisure industries of this region--to create high-quality leisure experiences--suggests that these Pacific Rim countries (e.g., Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, People's Republic of China, Tiawan, Australia, New Zealand, etc.) have much to offer the world through their leisure influences. The World EXPO in Australia with its theme, "Leisure in the Age of Technology," is but one example. This conference session chronicles the recent advances in leisure awareness and how leisure educators in the United States are networking to influence and be influenced. The role of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education and Dance and similar associations with liaison to the World Leisure and Recreation Association will be explored. (Author)

description1691=This document contains three papers from a symposium on standards and certification in human resource development (HRD). "Implementing Management Standards in the UK" (Jonathan Winterton, Ruth Winterton) reports on a study that explored the implementation of management standards in 16 organizations and identified 36 key themes and strategic issues regarding the following areas\: setting objectives in adopting standards; embedding standards; implementing standards; identifying competence needs and assessing competence; delivering management development; using and evaluating standards; determining standards' impacts and benefits; and addressing problems in adopting standards. "The Applicability of AHRD Ethics Standards Internationally" (Lisa A. Garrett, Gary N. McLean) explores the theory-building literature on ethics standards and global application of ethics codes and discusses the problems inherent in attempting to apply ethical standards that are applicable in one culture to other cultures. "Nature and Impact of ISO (International Standards Organization) Certification on Training and Development Activities in Singapore Organizations" (Hesan A. Quazi, Ronald L.

description1690=The Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) maintains a Regional Center for Educational Innovation and Technology (INNOTECH). INNOTECH's major responsibility is to assist member nations by determining common educational problems and solutions thereto, by offering training to key personnel, and by providing a clearinghouse for information exchange. Although the project which is reported on here is titled Project Clear to indicate its clearinghouse function, it is the result of a training exercise conducted to acquaint various educators with first-hand knowledge of a variety of planning and development projects in the region. Sixteen projects from six countries--Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam--are reported. The purpose of each project is listed, along with an indication of its current status, a full description of its details, and mention of points of interest to other innovators. Topics of the projects cover a wide range, including test development, skill development centers, primary school math and science, educational television, technical education, family planning, and the establishment of a national junior college.

description1685=Human Capital Alliance looks at how Xiaomi has disrupted the smartphone business with a new business model. Digital disruption of business models is forcing many leaders to create new visions of change into their business strategies. A recent Wired magazine’s article “Xiaomi’s Internet Thinking” shows how a Chinese smartphone manufacturer has created a massively successful business on the back of virtually zero-margin hardware by building a customer platform of 160 million people. Xiaomi makes more money by selling services and branded accessories produced by start-ups in which it invests.” According to Wire, its ecosystem is a crucial innovation in the world of commoditized smart phones. Selling smartphones not enough Liu De, Xiaomi’s head of ecosystem products said that from an internet thinking perspective, just having better smartphones would not be enough to make Xiaomi a sustainable business. “We need to sell cooler products and have people coming at all times. It’s an important element of our acquisition and retention strategy . Quality phones at rock-bottom prices Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s CEO and founder built a company priced at $45 billion by developing a business that “turns’ its smartphone customers into “fans” who co-designers and evangelizers of life-style products. At the same time, Xiaomi transfers much of the market-demand risks to many small hardware start-ups in which it tactically invests between $US100,000 to $US500,000 and develops its ecosystem to deliver products on its platform. It incubates these start-ups and helps them develop and create make products to sell on Mi.com. These processes allow Xiaomi to slash costs by minimizing inventory and optimizing supply-chains by selling high-quality top-of-the market devices at low-price margin-obliterating prices and profiting from services, content and accessories. In 2015, Xiaomi sold more than 71 million devices. Initial emphasis – high-quality-products Xiaomi initially markets high-quality products to help create connected lifestyles with technological innovation. It’s now a smart-phone company and its Mi.com is China’s third largest e-commerce site and an internet services company, which even publishes games. On Mi.com it sells products ranging from power-banks to wearable’s to air and water purifiers –hundreds of products that create a lifestyle. The company also has 22 stand-alone MiHome centers in China. Huge volumes Xiaomi’s platform has successfully sold massive amounts of innovative top-quality technology products on its platform. It sold more than 10 million health wristbands in the first six months of 2015 per month; more than 10 million power banks and 60 inch TVs at a RMB4,999 ($US771) rock bottom price.

description1675=SparksLab Global Venture - Petnet(io) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire SlimDoggy Inc., giving Petnet access to SlimDoggy’s world class pet food database and patent pending technology which the company plans to incorporate into its “Smart” line of pet products. Together, Petnet and SlimDoggy aim to make feeding a pet and selecting appropriate pet food as simple and convenient as possible. The acquisition allows Petnet to leverage the data and methodologies SlimDoggy has developed into an innovative pet feeding system that empowers pet owners to improve the overall health of their pets through proper diet. In the U.S., pet owners are estimated to have spent nearly $24 billion on pet food in 2014. As the industry continues to thrive, data indicates that there are now more pets than children in U.S. households, with 180 million dogs and cats in the U.S. and more households owning a pet than having children. Additionally, consumer spending on smart home systems and products is expected to hit $39 billion by 2019. Petnet addresses the food-related needs of this growing demographic using a combination of pet food data and sensors to make proper pet feeding simple and convenient. The Petnet SmartFeeder will not only ensure proper servings of the correct food, but it will also alert the pet owner when the food supply is running low and will automatically have more delivered to your door when it is needed. "Our acquisition of SlimDoggy helps us to accelerate our vision of using technology to build a better world for pets,” said Carlos Herrera, Founder and CEO of Petnet. “We’re deploying a sensor-enabled system powered by SlimDoggy’s data that will guide pet owners to the perfect food recipe for their pet, help them maintain healthy portions, and automatically deliver food to their home when they need it. It`s the epitome of the connected home and the future of commerce.” The majority of pet owners are unaware of the correct portion size and quality of food to feed their pet. In the U.S., more than one-half of the dogs and cats are overweight or obese, which leads to 15 percent shorter lifespans, and increased risk of disease including diabetes, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular problems, and even some forms of cancer. “The amount and type of pet food is the single biggest decision a pet owner can make to impact their pet’s health. With the long and confusing pet food labels, consumers are left to guess when trying to make intelligent, healthy food and portion control decisions,” said Steve Pelletier, Founder and CEO of SlimDoggy, Inc. “We are excited to work closely with Petnet to improve the way pet food is served, evaluated, and purchased, all the while helping to keep pets as healthy as possible.”

description1672=This article is from Health and Quality of Life Outcomes , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: Instruments to measure mental health and well-being are largely developed and often used within Western populations and this compromises their validity in other cultures. A previous qualitative study in Singapore demonstrated the relevance of spiritual and religious practices to mental health, a dimension currently not included in exiting multi-dimensional measures. The objective of this study was to develop a self-administered measure that covers all key and culturally appropriate domains of mental health, which can be applied to compare levels of mental health across different age, gender and ethnic groups. We present the item reduction and validation of the Positive Mental Health (PMH) instrument in a community-based adult sample in Singapore. Methods\: Surveys were conducted among adult (21-65 years) residents belonging to Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicities. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA, CFA) were conducted and items were reduced using item response theory tests (IRT). The final version of the PMH instrument was tested for internal consistency and criterion validity. Items were tested for differential item functioning (DIF) to check if items functioned in the same way across all subgroups. Results\: EFA and CFA identified six first-order factor structure (General coping, Personal growth and autonomy, Spirituality, Interpersonal skills, Emotional support, and Global affect) under one higher-order dimension of Positive Mental Health (RMSEA \= 0.05, CFI \= 0.96, TLI \= 0.96). A 47-item self-administered multi-dimensional instrument with a six-point Likert response scale was constructed. The slope estimates and strength of the relation to the theta for all items in each six PMH subscales were high (range\:1.39 to 5.69), suggesting good discrimination properties. The threshold estimates for the instrument ranged from -3.45 to 1.61 indicating that the instrument covers entire spectrums for the six dimensions. The instrument demonstrated high internal consistency and had significant and expected correlations with other well-being measures. Results confirmed absence of DIF. Conclusions\: The PMH instrument is a reliable and valid instrument that can be used to measure and compare level of mental health across different age, gender and ethnic groups in Singapore.
description1671=In any business, going the extra mile is going to produce the best results. At Huxley Banking and Finance , we seek to do just that. One of our clients is a global investment firm. We have been working with them for several years, sourcing placements across specialist roles, particularly within their technology division. Last year they asked us to help them with a series of placements in a country in which we don’t currently operate - Canada. They had been unsuccessful in their search so far, and wanted to leverage the success we’d already had with them here in the UK. We looked at the issues they were facing – not being able to find people of the right calibre or with the right experience within their local area – and set to work on making this a global project. We knew where the sort of talent they were looking for existed in both Europe and America, so we involved two of our European offices as well as two of our North American offices alongside the UK office. We set about finding three types of candidates\: those already based in the area that we knew had the right skills; citizens of Canada currently based abroad but who had a desire to move back home; and citizens of other countries who had the knowledge and skills required, and who would welcome the opportunity for an international relocation. What made the difference? “It was crucial that we secured the investment in terms of time from our client in the first instance,” explains Ashley McCuskey, Client Relationship Manager at London Banking & Finance. “We worked hard to understand our clients’ strict brief, but in the initial stages that requires them to spend some time with us going through their exact needs.” After that all the profiles were sent through one contact, in this case, Ashley, who would then gather specific feedback on each one. “It meant I could make sure that the profiles we were sending consistently aligned with their strict brief,” she explains. “Every time we received feedback we would use that to refine our search further.” Within three weeks, our client had offered the first role to one of our candidates. After that it was a case of replicating the process to find the others. “It was a tricky market,” admits Ashley. “It was a candidate-driven market and finding the right people was certainly not easy, they were few and far between. Those candidates could more or less pick and choose the roles, so we also worked with the company to help them differentiate themselves, for instance, by offering to help with the relocation process.” Despite their current recruitment needs having been met, for both their UK and Canadian offices, the client still meets with us on a regularly basis. “They saw how well we worked, and they want to make sure that they are ready – and we were ready - as soon as the next opportunity arises,” states Ashley. Well-thought out solutions Emily Organ, Client Relationship Manager at London Banking & Finance, is responsible for meeting the recruitment needs of another financial client, this time in the UK. In this instance, it wasn’t just the quality of the candidates that was important, but finding a large number of candidates within a short space of time to meet a surge in requirements. Emily picks up the story\: “We’ve had this client for a number of years, but some of our work with them was intermittent, spot business. We felt that we needed to get to grips with the bigger picture, so we arranged meetings with various departments to understand their overall structure and high level strategy going forward. “In the wake of the financial crisis, all financial institutions have had to get to grips with the wave of new regulations imposed upon them. We knew that this firm was going to have to upskill in certain departments as a result, so we put forward our case for helping them. We were pleased to be chosen as a preferred supplier for a project last year – basically, two rounds of hiring around 100 contracts. “They chose us because of our knowledge of their business, but also because we worked like crazy to get the best candidates for them. I was constantly visiting their offices so I knew exactly where they were with the project, what they needed and whether requirements were changing as the project went on. We couldn’t have been more involved in the whole process. “In addition, we did everything we could to make their lives easier. For instance, not by just presenting them with the candidate profiles, but by outlining the case for each candidate in terms of their skills and experience. Highlighting which had worked for the institution previously, for instance. We ended up being the top performing supplier. Not only that, but we had the highest completion rate of those contracts, and the highest number of contractors whose contract was extended. They’ve now appointed us preferred agent.” To discuss this topic further or if you have any questions then please contact Ashley McCuskey (a.mccuskey@huxley.com) or Emily Organ (e.organ@huxley.com)

description1669=This paper discusses fee-based services in public libraries. The first section examines examples of charging for public library services in three countries\: the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland; and New Zealand. The intention is to consider the circumstances in which charging was introduced, the public's response in terms of the effect on usage, and an evaluation of whether the scheme is regarded as successful. The overall objective is to provide hard facts and statistics, in order that future decisions can be made without recourse to the emotional arguments of the past, which are largely based on purely philosophical grounds. The second section describes the Singapore experience, including\: the rationales for charging, e.g., as a means of reducing extravagant wants to the level of realistic means, and for controlling the demand for the limited number of terminals for providing access to electronic information; the fee schedule for small services that tend to be free in other countries; the use of a national cashcard for payments; and other initiatives, e.g., the Home Delivery Service, three-tiered reference service with charges for higher tiers, creation of an inquiry database, and establishment of a call center to deal with remote inquiries.

description1662="First published 1994 by Oxford University Press. First issued as an Oxford University Press paperback 1996"--Oxford reference online website\nThis Companion is both an alphabetically arranged reference work and, in its sum, a history, a map of modern poetry in English. From the last decade of the century, it offers a survey of the terrain, from 1900 to the present, and from Britain and America to New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, Trinidad, Zimbabwe - anywhere, in fact, where poets write in English. It charts the shift from 'poetry' to 'poetries' - from primarily British and American traditions to a rich diversity of younger poetic identities elsewhere. The only comprehensive work of its kind, it covers not just individual poets - some 1,500 of them - but also magazines, movements, concepts, and critical terms. Edited and introduced by Ian Hamilton, himself a notable poet, The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English has the distinction of including among its contributors many other celebrated poet-critics, often in intriguing author/subject combinations. For example, Tom Paulin writes on Ted Hughes, Christopher Reid on Elizabeth Bishop, Clive Wilmer on Ezra Pound, Jon Stallworthy on Rupert Brooke, Peter Porter on Lawrence Durrell, Seamus Heancy on Robert Lowell, Femi Oyebode on Jack Mapanje, and Anne Stevenson on Sylvia Plath. These and other writers offer lively and opinionated critical assessments as well as biographical and bibliographical information. And, as one soon discovers, twentieth-century poets have lived far from humdrum lives. Twenty-seven here had nervous breakdowns, nineteen served time in jail, fourteen died in battle, three were murdered, one executed. One played hockey for his country. There were fifteen suicides, and one poet who staged his own death only to reappear, still writing poetry, under a new name. From Abse and Auden to Zaturenska and Zukofsky, this is an essential work of reference for students, lovers of poetry, and for poets themselves\nDescription based on print version record\n

description1659=In 1995, the state of Minnesota participated in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), oversampling students to permit comparison with the United States as a whole and with other participating nations. The data generated by the assessment and its subsequent analyses provide informative insights as well as suggest questions for further exploration. In general, the results for Minnesota students were similar to those for the U.S. as a whole. Both Minnesota and the U.S. showed higher scores relative to other participating nations at the fourth grade, and declining relative scores at grades eight and twelve. Minnesota scores tended to be slightly higher than those for the U.S., and the decline in scores at grades eight and twelve was not as sharp in Minnesota as for the U.S. as a whole. There was, however, an exception in Minnesota science scores at the eighth grade level that led the Goals Panel to commission this study. This case study is an in-depth examination of why eighth grade science students in Minnesota were second only to Singapore in TIMSS. This study identifies several characteristics of science education that are unique to Minnesota that explain the state's world-class performance in eighth grade science. These characteristics include high expectations for all students, focus and coherence of curriculum, alignment fostered by the existence of "de facto" science standards, continuity, and capacity within the teaching profession.

description1658=This paper describes the activities of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) libraries have undertaken to promote reading by increasing awareness among their people. First, factors limiting reading habits in ASEAN libraries are addressed, including\: we are not a reading society, but a chatting society; the management of "3 M's" (man, money, and management strategies); and the lure of electronic media. Second, roles of local institutes or organizations in helping libraries to conduct reading habit promotion are examined, including the roles of family, libraries/librarians, mass media, and private and government sectors. Finally, some suggestions on effective methods and successful programs for reading habit promotion by ASEAN libraries are summarized, including\: (1) book-based programming such as book lists, reading programs, performances, craft activities, competitions, and individual activities; (2) bringing books to the public through exhibits, pamphlets and other printed materials, and reading groups; and (3) electronic formats. ASEAN Libraries participating were from six countries\: Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. (MES)
description1657=The Singaporean education system is undergoing many changes in order to develop schools and nation which cultivate learning and education. A crucial success factor to these initiatives is the teacher. Singapore needs reflective teachers who can continually reflect upon their own practices to find better ways of teaching as well as maintain their purpose and direction amid a sea of changes. This article describes attempts during the years of 2002 to 2004 to develop trainee teachers into more reflective teachers at the National Institute of Education (NIE), focusing specifically on the experience of two revamped pre-service teacher education modules. The experience suggests that a social constructivist approach, in which trainee teachers discuss and debate critical issues impinging on their professional practice, is more successful than the traditional "tell and regurgitate" approach, in developing reflective teachers.
description1656=Numerous researches have demonstrated the enormous role of teachers in achievements of students. Educated and motivated teacher that cares about the success of students devotes more effort to preparing the lesson and thus provides the students better conditions for achieving results. The problem occurs when teachers are not equally qualified, motivated and prepared so it is justified to ask why some people even opt for the teaching profession if they have no motivation for this noble profession. The purpose of this study is to highlight the diversities of the admission requirements to teacher colleges in developed and developing countries. Diversity of admission requirements will show that the selection of candidates can affect students' later academic achievements. Comparative analysis between developed and developing countries, precisely Finland, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Croatia, India, Russia and Turkey, determines if there are any differences in the admission requirements among the selected countries. The analysis and the qualitative approach to the statistical indicators of PISA tests conducted in 2012 show which group of countries achieves better results and points to the correlation of students' achievements and the admission requirements. Research results show that the developed countries have strict entry requirements to teacher colleges and have better understanding of the importance of selecting the best candidates into the teaching profession. Developed countries achieved better results in PISA tests which indicates to a connection between the selection of more capable candidates for teaching profession and student achievement. Research confirms that the role of the teacher is very important and that the future reforms of primary education should be extended to higher education, that is teacher education because teachers play a major role in the educational process.

description1644=Student teachers in Australia and Singapore were asked to solve a one-step ratio problem and to complete open sentences about the nature of mathematics and mathematics pedagogy. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the similarities and differences in proportional reasoning of the student teachers in Australia and Singapore through the approaches and strategies they used in solving the ratio problem. From their responses to the open sentences, this paper also presents the differences and similarities between the two country groups in their beliefs about the nature of mathematics and how mathematics is learned and taught. The relationships between beliefs about mathematics and variables in solving the ratio problem are discussed with particular reference to the curriculum and pedagogical contexts in Australia and Singapore.

description1643=This article is from BMC Public Health , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: The increase in life expectancy and the persistence of expectancy gaps between different social groups in the 20th century are well-described in Western developed countries, but less well documented in the newly industrialised countries of Asia. Singapore, a multiethnic island-state, has undergone a demographic and epidemiologic transition concomitant with economic development. We evaluate secular trends and differences in life expectancy by ethnicity and gender in Singapore, from independence to the present. Methods\: Period abridged life tables were constructed to derive the life expectancy of the Singapore population from 1965 to 2009 using data from the Department of Statistics and the Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore. Results\: All 3 of Singapore’s main ethnic groups, and both genders, experienced an increase in life expectancy at birth and at 65 years from 1965 to 2009, though at substantially different rates. Although there has been a convergence in life expectancy between Indians and Chinese, the (substantial) gap between Malays and the other two ethnic groups has remained. Females continued to have a higher life expectancy at birth and at 65 years than males throughout this period, with no evidence of convergence. Conclusions\: Ethnic and gender differences in life expectancy persist in Singapore despite its rapid economic development. Targeted chronic disease prevention measures and health promotion activities focusing on people of Malay ethnicity and the male community may be needed to remedy this inequality.
description1642=This article is from Indian Journal of Palliative Care , volume 17 . Abstract Palliative care is a growing area of practice throughout the world and its promotion relies on adequately trained health care professionals. However, there are only a limited number of postgraduate academic courses or clinical training opportunities available, especially in resource challenged areas of the Asia Pacific region. This article outlines a creative endeavour between Flinders University, Adelaide Australia, the Singapore National Cancer Centre and the Asia Pacific Hospice and Palliative Care Network to provide an educational opportunity for students from the region. The strengths of the programme include its strong theoretical and evidenced-based framework, its multidisciplinary inclusiveness and its innovative and interactive teaching style. The main teaching challenge for the teaching team is to deliver culturally appropriate curricula to students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. This postgraduate programme is an important initiative for the region and for the development of future leaders and pioneers in the discipline.
description1641=Background\: The Project Yi Jin (PYJ), an alternative pathway for secondary school leavers and adults to further their education, has been receiving full support from the government, the Federation for Continuing Education in Tertiary Institutions (FCE) in Hong Kong and the public. Graduates of PYJ have the equivalent academic status of their counterparts in the main stream education. It was first implemented in 2000/01 by the FCE and has been offered to more than 35,000 students by 2006/07. With the success of the programme as a safety-net for a mass education system, it should continue to function more vigorously as new reforms are being implemented in the Hong Kong education scene in the future. The Chief Executive in his 2004 Policy Address has set out the direction to develop a new secondary and university system, i.e., (3+3) for secondary + 4 (tertiary) [the old one is (3+2+2)+3], to be launched in 2010/11, that will effectively prepare the next generation to cope with the challenges of the 21st century and the demands of the rapidly developing knowledge-based society. The new system, together with substantial modified curricula including the newly developed applied learning courses (ApL), is supposed to be able to look after all secondary students. Aims and focus of discussion\: This paper aims to argue the necessity of launching a new version of Project Yi Jin (nPYJ) concurrently together with the new 3+3+4 academic system. In light of the contemporary global educational systems as compared to that of Hong Kong, it is postulated that the launching of nPYJ as a continuation of the successful PYJ is both legitimate and indispensable with regard to the carefully observed current global fashion of lifelong learning and continuing education in which diversity, equity, and flexibility are highly valued. Method\: A comprehensive comparative review was carried out on eleven selected oriental and occidental countries and regions, namely, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea, United Kingdom, United States, China, Taiwan, Singapore and Macao, focusing on the worldwide trend of constant high school drop-out rate as well as the mentioned countries' respective senior secondary schooling articulation policy leading to higher education, in particular shedding light on the establishment of alternative pathways towards tertiary education alongside the conventional educational track. Conclusion\: With the literature backdrop and empirical support, it is shown that high school drop-outs are inevitable no matter how well-defined an education system may be. Thus this is where the "safety-net" contingency plan is found essential. A new version of Project Yi Jin (nPYJ), to be offered in parallel with the Hong Kong's new 3+3+4 secondary academic curricula, is indispensable to the new educational structure in the territory which fundamentally helps transform the conventionally somewhat segregated and elite educational system into a mass one. Regarding the curricular design, both PYJ and nPYJ will focus on generic skills and a wide range of electives will be offered as well to arouse students' interest of study.

description1640=Whether poor knowledge of evolution among Singapore students might be linked to low levels of content knowledge about evolution among junior high school and senior high school teachers was studied. A teacher questionnaire on biological evolution was developed. Twelve teachers from Singapore junior college (JC) schools and 42 from the lower secondary schools completed the survey, which was judged to have acceptable reliability. Classical item analyses and Rasch item analyses were performed. Both JC and lower secondary teachers had a reasonably good grasp of the subject matter in evolution and ecology, with JC teachers having significantly better understanding of evolution than that of lower-level teachers. Even though teachers displayed a fairly good understanding of the subject matter, there were some alternative conceptions observed, especially among secondary teachers. Avoidance of some of these alternative conceptions should be emphasized in teacher training. (Contains 4 tables and 24 references.) (SLD)

description1636=Hong Kong has always been proud of its economic achievement of the past decades. However, the economic turmoil that swept over East Asia has revealed the weakness in its economy, which, in turn, urges Hong Kong to reform its education system to meet the challenge of this era of information technology. There are many problems in Hong Kong's education system, including elitism, teacher-centered classrooms, outdated curricula, and ambiguous language policies. At the same time, Hong Kong is faced with fierce competition with its neighboring cities, notably Shanghai and Singapore. There is concern that Hong Kong cannot produce the suitable manpower to meet the needs of the changing economy. Reform proposals were first introduced in May 2001, with "student-focused learning,""no-loser,""quantity,""life-long learning," and "society-wide mobilization" as guiding principles. This paper aims at examining the reform proposals, their problems and possibilities, and their implications through contextual analysis and literature review. The significance of Hong Kong's education reform may help shed some light on education reform in other parts of the world facing similar problems in the process of rapid economic and social change.

description1634=Technology and education are both rapidly being internationalized. In order to promote exchanges and cooperation in technology education between Asian countries and New Zealand, it is necessary to study the trends in Asian countries. The following trends were found in five Asian countries or economies (Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan)\: (1) flexibility in technology education in national curricula is increasing; (2) information technology is being increasingly incorporated into technology education; (3) the design process is becoming a new focus of technology education; (4) and the integration of technological content organizers is a new direction in technology education. The implications of these trends for New Zealand are that there should be more dialogue between New Zealand and Asian technology educators, and that computers should be applied as a vital tool in technological learning and teaching.

description1632=In December 1996 UNESCO commissioned the Australian Broadcasting Authority to conduct a pilot study which considered a range of online issues; this report outlines the findings of the pilot study, based on data collected between February and May 1997 and updated in July 1997. The objective is to identify the main types of Internet content which may be considered illegal in the countries in the pilot study, along with the Internet content which, while legal, may be unsuitable or harmful for children. The four countries selected for the study were Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The report is divided into two parts. Part 1 provides an overview of the nature of the online environment and some of its important features; identifies some of the issues arising in the online services; and also identifies some of the technical developments which enable parents and supervisors to protect children from harmful or unsuitable material in the online environment. Part 2 provides a comparison and an overview of the four countries in the study, presenting a context for the subsequent discussion; identifies some of the approaches being taken in the four countries in response to the Internet; and presents some comparative data collected on some of the issues raised in Part 1. Appendices include a list of contributors; services available online; acronyms and abbreviations; and useful Web resources. (AEF)

description1627=Source\: http\://westhillconsulting-blog.quora.com/Go-and-Travel-to-Jakarta Westhill Consulting Travel and Tours Singapore one of our most popular destinations Chaotic, crazy and crowded. But that’s what makes Indonesia’s capital so unique. There are places you will fall in love with at first sight and some that you won’t. It’s usually the first impressions that makes us love or hate a place. But cities are like women. Some will throw themselves at you, and some will make you chase them. Which woman would you go for? Jakarta, Indonesia is an example of the latter, you have to dig a little bit deeper to get to know her. She may seem hesitant at first and is happy to let you wait, until you take the time to properly understand her. Then, she’ll give you everything you need. To me, she might even be the unofficial queen of Southeast Asia. Jakarta is not Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur or Singapore. Some people say “If you don’t like her, she won’t like you”. After a few days I understood why. To be honest, after landing in Jakarta I had no idea what to expect. You don’t hear much about it and as soon as you exit the terminal you already feel lost. It is big and hot and busy. Not to mention the traffic. I didn’t really get the vibe at first. Although soon enough, I understood what the magic of Jakarta was. It is truly Asia, more so than many other Southeast Asian cities you will discover on your journey. So here are a few reasons why you should experience Jakarta for yourself. Jakarta traffic is more symbolic of ‘Asia’ than Bangkok and Saigon put together Three million cars, nine million motorbikes and inadequate public transport. Experts predict that in 2014 the whole traffic in the city will collapse. During rush hour the average speed in the inner city is around 10 km/h and if you’re lucky, it will only take you three hours to get to work. The average citizen of Jakarta has his breakfast in the car on their way to work. Yes the traffic in Jakarta is full on and you need superhuman patience and nerves of steel to survive it. But it can also have positive effects. During rush hour there needs to be at least three people in the car otherwise drivers get fined, and a lot of Indonesian mothers who normally would have trouble finding employment have taken this fact and used it to their advantage. They offer their presence to wealthy businessmen and sitting in their car with them during these peak hours to help them avoid the fine in exchange for some income. Genius. Find a rooftop on any evening and listen to adzan, Islam’s call to prayer My CouchSurfing host lived somewhere in the middle of the city in a typically tall building. I explored its rooftop which overlooked the surrounding areas and on the horizon was a beautiful view of Jakarta’s skyline. It was around 7 p.m. when the sun was going to rest, when the call to prayer occurred. It was such a unique experience in this city. You could hear it from many mosques all over the city. It is hard to explain what I felt at that moment, but it really left an impression. Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation with 87 percent following Islam as their religion. If people are talking about going to the ‘stadium’ they ain’t talking about football No opinion in Jakarta is more divided than those about the Stadium. Some people love it, and others hate it. You hear many, many stories about it and it’s up to you whether you believe them or not. One thing is for sure, whenever you ask about Jakarta’s nightlife someone will mention the Stadium. What is this place though and why is it so popular? Well, one thing that is heavily associated with it are drugs. Sure, you will find drugs in any night club in the world but at the Stadium it seems to be a continuous issue due to the fact that because most Indonesians don’t drink alcohol due to their religious beliefs, they might substitute it with a pill instead. True or not, most of world’s top DJ’s have performed or will most likely perform at Stadium at some point in their careers. It is a great place with awesome acts and a great audience. Otherwise people wouldn’t talk about it. I reckon it is a must see and if you like good techno, then the Stadium is definitely worth checking out. You can experience Indonesia in just one day in Jakarta How can I see a whole country in a day by just staying in Jakarta, that doesn’t make sense. Yes that’s what I thought too. My local friends took me to a park called Taman Mini Indonesia Indah, which essentially translates to “Beautiful Indonesia Miniature Park”. The park was opened in 1975 and unfortunately doesn’t really look well maintained. The lizard house especially looked a bit sad and I felt sorry for the animals. But once you’re there you get the chance to pat a Komodo dragon, even though it probably hasn’t moved since 1975. But it’s still a great way to get to know the local culture of each province in Indonesia. You get to learn about local habits, look at different architecture, clothing, food and many more aspects of Indonesia’s culture. There is a big lake in the middle of the park with a little island in the shape of the country. If you have the guts to take the cable car you can enjoy a stunning view of it from above. Indonesians will make you feel like a star First of all, Indonesians are super hospitable people and they are very friendly towards foreigners. But there aren’t as many foreign tourists in Jakarta as you might think. You will get a lot of attention and the locals will genuinely be very keen to get to know you. That’s in fact amazing to me. In Thailand a lot of the locals seem to get easily bemused and simultaneously annoyed by the mass tourists, and this won’t be the case in Indonesia. The most surprising thing was the local CouchSurfing scene though. I’d received about a hundred various emails offering help, recommendations and hosting offers. I was blown away by the kindness of those people so I decided to meet as many as I could. We organized a big CouchSurfing meeting and many local Indonesian travelers attended. Their enthusiasm was unbelievable and I made a lot of friends that day. Even a crew from Metro TV came and filmed a little documentary for the national channel about CouchSurfing.

description1608=Germany's Dual System, which consists of in-school and in-enterprise components, facilitates entry into 374 recognized technical, white-collar and blue-collar occupations listed in training regulations that are grounded in legislation. The Dual System's origins and development in Germany were examined along with several attempts to replicate the German model in other countries. The literature on transfer and replication of the Dual System model was reviewed, and micro case studies of attempts to adopt the German model in the following countries were presented\: Botswana; Costa Rica; the Dominican Republic; India; Indonesia; Lebanon; Seychelles; Singapore; and Sri Lanka. Reflections of Germany's Dual System in United States work-based youth apprenticeships were also considered. Of all the countries examined in the micro case studies, only Singapore seems to have replicated the German record of participation of 64%-81% of 16- to 18-year-olds in the Dual System. It was concluded that integration of academic and technical-vocational curricula is extremely difficult in nations where technical and vocational education and training is often perceived to be second-class education. It was further concluded that Germany's culture of in-firm training may be the most difficult-to-develop attribute of the Dual System in developed and developing nations alike.

description1607=This article is from Asia Pacific Family Medicine , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: In Singapore, SingHealth Polyclinics (SHP) is an accredited Family Medicine (FM) training centre which managed 1.8 million primary care patient-visits in 2012. To promote research in the institution, research consultation clinics (RCC) are being introduced in 2010 to enable free face-to-face consultation between experienced and novice researchers on specific research topics. Each RCC session allows about an hour or more for the SHP staff, medical undergraduates and general practitioners to seek advice and clarification on key research areas, ranging from research question refinement, study design and execution, data analysis, result presentation to publication. The consultants comprise of two FM researchers with postgraduate research qualification. Aim\: This article aims to review the implementation of RCC from 2010 to 2012 and its impact on research activities and outcome indicators in the same period of time. Methods\: The study comprised of two segments. Part I was a three-year retrospective review of the RCC administrative record. The total number of RCC sessions, hours utilised, participants’ profiles, the number of research studies initiated by them and their research presentations at local and overseas scientific meetings/conferences were computed. Part 2 was an anonymous web-based questionnaire survey fielded to RCC participants to collect their feedback on the RCC service and their self-reported initiation and completion of research study after the RCC consultation. Results\: The RCC sessions increased from 17 to 40 sessions, resulting in increment of 2 to 14 research presentations and from 2 to 6 initiations of new research studies per annum from 2010–2012. The response rate to the questionnaire survey was 70.3%, with the majority of multi-disciplinary respondents rated the RCC service to be accessible, adequate and were satisfied with its quality. Study design, data management and study execution were ranked as important areas of research for consultation. 79% of them had started a research project and 36% had completed their studies. Conclusions\: The RCC is a feasible model to catalyse multi-disciplinary research in primary care institutions. Further study is needed to evaluate its relevance when research advances and novice researchers become experienced investigators to take on more complex projects.

description1605=This article is from BMC Cancer , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men in Sweden and Geneva, and the third most common in men in Singapore. This population-based study describes trends in the incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer in Singapore, Sweden and Geneva (Switzerland) from 1973 to 2006 and explores possible explanations for these different trends. Methods\: Data from patients diagnosed with prostate cancer were extracted from national cancer registries in Singapore (n \= 5,172), Sweden (n \= 188,783) and Geneva (n \= 5,755) from 1973 to 2006. Trends of incidence and mortality were reported using the Poisson and negative binomial regression models. The age, period and birth-cohort were tested as predictors of incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer. Results\: Incidence rates of prostate cancer increased over all time periods for all three populations. Based on the age-period-cohort analysis, older age and later period of diagnosis were associated with a higher incidence of prostate cancer, whereas older age and earlier period were associated with higher mortality rates for prostate cancer in all three countries. Conclusions\: This study demonstrated an overall increase in incidence rates and decrease in mortality rates in Singapore, Sweden and Geneva. Both incidence and mortality rates were much lower in Singapore. The period effect is a stronger predictor of incidence and mortality of prostate cancer than the birth-cohort effect.

description1579=This article is from BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: The key aim of triage in chest pain patients is to identify those with high risk of adverse cardiac events as they require intensive monitoring and early intervention. In this study, we aim to discover the most relevant variables for risk prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) using clinical signs and heart rate variability. Methods\: A total of 702 chest pain patients at the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary hospital in Singapore were included in this study. The recruited patients were at least 30 years of age and who presented to the ED with a primary complaint of non-traumatic chest pain. The primary outcome was a composite of MACE such as death and cardiac arrest within 72 h of arrival at the ED. For each patient, eight clinical signs such as blood pressure and temperature were measured, and a 5-min ECG was recorded to derive heart rate variability parameters. A random forest-based novel method was developed to select the most relevant variables. A geometric distance-based machine learning scoring system was then implemented to derive a risk score from 0 to 100. Results\: Out of 702 patients, 29 (4.1%) met the primary outcome. We selected the 3 most relevant variables for predicting MACE, which were systolic blood pressure, the mean RR interval and the mean instantaneous heart rate. The scoring system with these 3 variables produced an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.812, and a cutoff score of 43 gave a sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of 63.4%, while the scoring system with all the 23 variables had an AUC of 0.736, and a cutoff score of 49 gave a sensitivity of 72.4% and specificity of 63.0%. Conventional thrombolysis in myocardial infarction score and the modified early warning score achieved AUC values of 0.637 and 0.622, respectively. Conclusions\: It is observed that a few predictors outperformed the whole set of variables in predicting MACE within 72 h. We conclude that more predictors do not necessarily guarantee better prediction results. Furthermore, machine learning-based variable selection seems promising in discovering a few relevant and significant measures as predictors.
description1578=This article is from PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases , volume 8 . Abstract Weather factors are widely studied for their effects on indicating dengue incidence trends. However, these studies have been limited due to the complex epidemiology of dengue, which involves dynamic interplay of multiple factors such as herd immunity within a population, distinct serotypes of the virus, environmental factors and intervention programs. In this study, we investigate the impact of weather factors on dengue in Singapore, considering the disease epidemiology and profile of virus serotypes. A Poisson regression combined with Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) was used to evaluate and compare the impact of weekly Absolute Humidity (AH) and other weather factors (mean temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and wind speed) on dengue incidence from 2001 to 2009. The same analysis was also performed on three sub-periods, defined by predominant circulating serotypes. The performance of DLNM regression models were then evaluated through the Akaike's Information Criterion. From the correlation and DLNM regression modeling analyses of the studied period, AH was found to be a better predictor for modeling dengue incidence than the other unique weather variables. Whilst mean temperature (MeanT) also showed significant correlation with dengue incidence, the relationship between AH or MeanT and dengue incidence, however, varied in the three sub-periods. Our results showed that AH had a more stable impact on dengue incidence than temperature when virological factors were taken into consideration. AH appeared to be the most consistent factor in modeling dengue incidence in Singapore. Considering the changes in dominant serotypes, the improvements in vector control programs and the inconsistent weather patterns observed in the sub-periods, the impact of weather on dengue is modulated by these other factors. Future studies on the impact of climate change on dengue need to take all the other contributing factors into consideration in order to make meaningful public policy recommendations.
description1577=A survey of 24 English-as-a-Second-Language teacher trainees in Singapore elicited their top five criteria for evaluating language-learning software and their interpretations and understanding of one criterion, "user-friendliness." It was found that in general, this was the first criterion listed for software evaluation; the others were, in descending order of mention, appropriateness, interest, use of animated graphics, educational value, quality of being fun to use, and relevant content. The most popular definitions for "user-friendly" included\: simple to use or having simple instructions; having help easily available; ease of navigation; useful icons; and technical knowledge not required. The potential for ambiguity in use of the term is highlighted. It is noted that a majority of the respondents saw themselves as below-average in computer expertise and were concerned about the amount of time available for using technology in a highly-structured classroom and curriculum, and lack of technical support. Implications for policy and practice are examined briefly. Contains 19 references. (MSE)
description1576=Tomography of the two qubit density matrix shared by Alice and Bob is an essential ingredient for guaranteeing an acceptable margin of confidentiality during the establishment of a secure fresh key through the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) scheme. We show how the Singapore protocol for key distribution is optimal from this point of view, due to the fact that it is based on so called SIC POVM qubit tomography which allows the most accurate full tomographic reconstruction of an unknown density matrix on the basis of a restricted set of experimental data. We illustrate with the help of experimental data the deep connections that exist between SIC POVM tomography and discrete Wigner representations. We also emphasise the special role played by Bell states in this approach and propose a new protocol for Quantum Key Distribution during which a third party is able to concede or to deny A POSTERIORI to the authorized users the ability to build a fresh cryptographic key.
description1575=We have all heard the statistics. About how China is forecast to overtake the U.S. to be the largest economy in the world by 2027. How China already has 277 million mobile web users, of which 45 percent use their handsets to access music and 21 per cent video games. How more than 300 million Chinese are studying English. How Chinese e–commerce is predicted to triple by 2015, when sales could hit $420 billion—20 percent higher than the projection for the U.S. market. And how, at 67,300, China sends more students to U.K. universities than any other country in the world. These dizzying numbers should mean there is a particularly large market for the U.K.’s creative industries, right? The trade statistics suggest not. According to UNCTAD, in 2010 the U.K.’s share of creative goods exports to China was just 1.4 percent, compared with a 4.8 percent share in world creative goods exports. U.K. exports of creative goods to China totaled $140 million, lower than not only Japan ($900 million), the U.S. ($800 million), and Singapore ($520 million), but also France ($224 million), Germany ($325 million), and Italy ($474 million). With the exception of Japan and Germany, the value of U.K. exports of creative goods grew at a slower rate than in all these countries between 2002 and 2010. These trade statistics are not without their problems—they exclude all creative services, for example—nonetheless they indicate that the U.K.’s creative industries are punching below their weight in Chinese markets.

description1573=12 flight booking hacks that will guarantee you the cheapest tickets Every frequent traveler has their own tricks for booking the best and cheapest flight possible. Luckily, some were willing to share their secrets on a Quora thread that asked, "what are the best flight booking hacks?" Keep scrolling for some tips and tricks that may make all the difference. 1. Look at all your options. Quora user Saran Udayakumar, who has 45,000 miles in the sky under his belt, says that when he's booking flights he makes sure to check travel search engines like Kayak, Priceline, and Skyscanner, as well as airlines' websites. 2. Don't be opposed to layovers. This may seem like an obvious one, but nonstop flights are typically more expensive than flights with layovers. So if you're looking for the cheapest possible option, Udayakumar says to consider booking a flight with a layover. 3. Clear your cookies or open an incognito tab before booking. According to Udayakumar, travel agencies and airlines often use your computer's cookies to determine what kind of flight you're interested in booking. Once they discover what you're looking for, they'll often raise prices accordingly. 4. Book a connection you know you're not going to make. This hack is better suited for risk takers, as it involves gambling with airlines. Udayakumar suggests booking a cheap flight with a super short connection time that's almost impossible to make. 5. Don't only rely on big-name airlines when flying internationally. According to Quora user Patrick Keane, a frequent flyer with Star Alliance and a Lufthansa eXperts member, some airlines you probably haven't heard often offer the cheapest fares for transatlantic flights. 6. Fake your computer's IP address to fudge your location. Flight prices differ widely from country to country, says Quora user and avid traveler Anya Mary. Often fares are cheaper in countries with lower living standards, so pretending you're booking from, say, India, instead of the US, can make all the difference. 7. Book a flight with a layover that's actually your end destination. Quora user Gaurav Srivastava refers to this hack as "hidden city ticketing." Here's the example Srivastava uses to explain the trick\: Say you're flying from New York to Chicago and you find a cheap flight that goes from New York to Kentucky, but with a layover in Chicago (chances are a flight like this will be cheaper than a nonstop flight from New York to Chicago). Book that flight and then just disembark in Chicago (don't board the connecting flight to Kentucky). 8. Look out for "fifth-freedom flights." Srivastava explains that the "fifth freedom refers to the right for an airline to carry revenue traffic between two foreign countries as part of a service connecting the airline’s home country." 9. Book an early flight when you can. Turns out waking up at the crack of dawn for an early flight is worth it. Quora user Dan Birchall highlights a few reasons why. 10. Consider booking one way tickets and flying into and out of different cities. While booking a round trip ticket in and out of the same city might seem like the easiest, most logical way to go, Quora user Jeff Mccoy says that it's not always the cheapest. Sometimes, booking two one way tickets that arrive in and depart from different cities can save you a lot of money. 11. Search for one-person flights even if you're booking for multiple people. If the first search you perform for a flight is for multiple seats, the airline might hike up prices, McCoy says. So instead, start by searching for a flight for just one person, and look into booking for multiple people later. 12. Use Points Loyalty Wallet to trade and/or buy points and miles. "Trading or buying a few extra miles might be all you need to earn a travel reward," McCoy says. Points Loyalty Wallet lets you do both of those things, and it's worth checking out.

description1570=A study investigated parents' perceptions of the quality of kindergarten education in Singapore. Subjects (437 parents from 10 kindergartens) responded to a survey on reasons for wanting their children to attend kindergarten and their choice of kindergarten. Responses were categorized according to\: (1) socioeconomic characteristics of the parents; (2) factors in the choice of kindergarten such as qualified staff, good facilities, individual attention, a strong academic program, emphasis on language learning, and a good academic reputation; (3) choice between private and government-aided kindergartens; (4) parents' reasons for sending children to kindergarten; and (5) parental expectations. Findings indicated that parents generally had a fairly definite idea of the kind of kindergarten education they wanted for their children, and revealed that\: (1) parents in Singapore value kindergarten education for exposing their children to a structured learning situation; (2) all parents regarded preparing children for school (acquiring basic cognitive skills and language competencies) as the most important function of kindergarten; (3) most parents considered quality more important than personal convenience or financial commitment; (4) parents from the high SES group favored private kindergartens while those from the low SES favored government-aided kindergartens; (5) high SES parents rated cognitive skills, social skills, and discipline training as more important than did low SES parents; and (6) socioeconomic factors had varying effects on parents' kindergarten decisions and expectations.

description1569=Mathematics education has emerged to be of prime importance in the United States, as American students' performance has shown to be consistently and significantly lower than many other nations in the world (Rampey, Dion, & Donahue, 2009; National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.; OECD Programme for International Student Assessment, n.d.). Sparked by an interest to understand factors that are associated with such differential performance, mathematics education researchers have been drawn to international comparative research. In order to understand the differences and similarities between the U.S. and other countries across multiple dimensions of the learning and teaching of mathematics, curricula, and educational systems, international comparative studies in mathematics education have resulted in both in-depth, qualitative studies as well as hard, quantitative data analyses. Most prominent studies include those that compare the U.S. and other high-performing East Asian countries such as China, Korea, Singapore, and Japan, across elementary and middle school levels (Cai, 2000, 2002; Kaiser, Leung, Romberg, & Yaschenko, 2002; Leung, 2001; Paik, 2004; Stevenson, 1993; Stevenson & Stigler, 1992; Stigler, Lee & Stevenson, 1987; Tsao, 2004). However, there is a dearth of studies that focus on high school students, especially in comparing those of South Korea with the United States. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap in research, and to identify the extent to which different cultural and institutional factors influence student mathematical learning. Specifically, this will be a comparative analysis between high school students in South Korea and the United States, across three context levels\: national level, school organizational level (e.g., mathematics curricula), and modes of mathematical problem solving and preference (e.g., metacognition). By using available data from the PISA 2003 study, which had a focus on mathematical learning, the author employed hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to analyze how much variation in student performance can be accounted for by various levels of contexts, and specifically examine the relationship between student modes of mathematical problem solving and preference for learning environments and their actual learning outcomes. The preliminary results indicate that the cognitive strategies and preference for learning environments share some similarities and differences across Korea and the United States. In addition, these factors are differentially associated with mathematical performance. As mentioned before, these results are based on a simple model and are amenable to change after the inclusion of country-level and other factors which have not yet been examined. However, based on these results, one could argue that significant differences exist on the use of elaboration techniques and its relationship to students' mathematical performance, as well as on the relationships between preference for cooperative or competitive learning environments and students' actual performance. This study points to the importance of more in-depth qualitative studies that will illuminate the processes in which students engage in these problem strategies, and investigate whether there could be any universal deliverables that can be ported to other learning contexts. This study also points to the importance of understanding the overarching context in which learning occurs, as societal, institutional, cultural values can influence the relationship between cognition and performance in different ways.

description1568=Human resources and information technologies are two of the most important cornerstones in the government's development policy in Singapore. This study investigated the process by which university teachers arrived at the positive perception of computer-assisted instruction (CAI). The CAI survey was distributed to 118 randomly selected (education and business) teachers at one of two leading universities in Singapore; 63 teachers (53%) responded. This study revealed that the knowledge of CAI was a dominant factor influencing the perceived usefulness of CAI after all\: the higher the CAI knowledge level is, the higher the positive perception of CAI will be. This finding may be an indication of the Singapore's favorable climate for instructional technology use for school and university teachers, yet the world's educational communities should take note of it.

description1567=The study of nano-cylinder structure has attracted much attention due to the application of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). while some TEM observations indicate that they are formed by seamless concentric cylinders, other TEM and high pressure X-ray diffraction studies suggest that they look like scrolls of graphite sheets. Although many people now accept the concentric cylinder model, there has been no confirmation reported. On the other hand, this structural difference of MWCNTs plays a crucial role in determining the properties and suitability for future applications. For example, the periodical boundary condition can only be imposed for cylinders, but not for scrolls. To resolve this issue, we employed high-resolution X-ray diffraction to measure detailed profiles of the Bragg peaks for high-purity MWCNTs. We then identified some unusual observations unique to the nano-cylinder structure, followed by the analysis of the structural difference in the Fourier transform between nanotubes formed by scrolls and concentric cylinders. The simulation results are then compared with the experimental data to reveal the structural details.

description1559=The correlation dimension and limit capacity serve theoretically as lower and upper bounds, respectively, of the fractal dimension of attractors of dynamic systems. In this paper, we show that estimates of the correlation dimension grow rapidly with increasing noise level in the time-series, while estimates of the limit capacity remain relatively unaffected. It is therefore proposed that the limit capacity be used in studies of noisy data, despite its heavier computational requirements. An analysis of Singapore wind data with the limit capacity estimate revealed a surprisingly low dimension (~2.5). It is suggested that further studies be made with comprehensive equatorial weather data.

description1555=In the primary school classrooms, students spend almost three terms (20-25 hours) doing project work in groups of 4-5. In order for any learning task to be conducted effectively, the students need to know how to work collaboratively in their groups, and teachers need to find out how their students perceive one another while working in their groups. This will in turn help teachers help their students build the interdependence and team spirit needed to develop the correct attitude toward project work. The objectives of this study are to assist teachers better understand how their students collaborate with one another in their groups, and to suggest strategies to enhance students collaboration in the classroom. Subjects were 39 primary (grade 6) students from an all-girl school in Singapore. Using one of the standard learning environment instruments, the My Class Inventory (MCI), students perceptions of their actual and preferred learning environments are assessed. This paper will report the results and suggest how it will be used to assist in developing appropriate strategies to enhance collaboration in project work classrooms.

description1554=Countless policy makers and researchers have flocked to observe the education systems of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore, which are among the top five performers in the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) 2009 reading assessment. Many visitors have been particularly impressed by the fact that these education systems succeed in embracing the social heterogeneity in their student populations that is intrinsic to large urban environments--something that many other education systems struggle to achieve. But large cities do not just pose social challenges to educators; they also offer important advantages for schools, such as a richer cultural environment, a more attractive workplace for teachers, more school choice, and better job prospects that can help to motivate students. New analyses from PISA highlight these advantages, showing that, in several countries, students from urban areas (defined here as cities with over a million inhabitants) do as well as students in PISA's top performing city-states, even if the different push and pull factors of urban environments play out very differently across countries. This paper reports that\: (1) Large cities are generally educational assets\: in most countries, performance improves dramatically when only the scores of students in urban areas are considered, although this is not the case in some countries, such as Belgium, Slovenia, the United Kingdom and the United States; and (2) When comparing the performance of students in large cities, students in Portugal and Israel perform as well as those in Singapore, and students in Poland perform as well as those in Hong Kong.
description1553=This article focuses on an attempt by a teacher education institute to empower non-English majors to teach English at the primary level, drawing on a preservice English-language teacher education program for undergraduates at the National Institute of Education, Singapore. The course, which has been running for three years, aims to develop student teachers' skills in analyzing grammatical features in primary-level writing, based on a three-step approach designed by the author specifically for non-English majors. The article also explores the difficulties that student teachers face in learning to identify, classify, and explain various types of errors, including suggestions on how to empower student teachers to help primary-level pupils understand and use grammar rules effectively.

description1545=This article is from Journal of Emergencies, Trauma, and Shock , volume 7 . Abstract Background\:\: Trauma injury is the leading cause of mortality and hospitalization worldwide and the leading cause of potential years of productive life lost. Patients with multiple injuries are prevalent, increasing the complexity of trauma care and treatment. Better understanding of the nature of trauma risk and outcome could lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies. Materials and Methods\:\: A retrospective review of 1178 trauma patients with Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 9, who were admitted to the Acute and Emergency Care of an acute care hospital between January 2011 and December 2012. The statistical analysis included calculation of percentages and proportions and application of test of significance using Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Results\:\: Over the study period, 1178 patients were evaluated, 815 (69.2%) males and 363 (30.8%) females. The mean age of patients was 52.08 ± 21.83 (range 5-100) years. Falls (604; 51.3%) and road traffic accidents (465; 39.5%) were the two most common mechanisms of injury. Based on the three most common mechanisms of injury, i.e. fall on the same level, fall from height, and road traffic accident, the head region (484; 45.40%) was the most commonly injured in the body, followed by lower limbs (377; 35.37%) and thorax (299; 28.05%). Conclusion\:\: Fall was the leading cause of injury among the elderly population with road traffic injuries being the leading cause among the younger group. There is a need to address the issues of injury control and prevention in these areas.

description1543=This article is from Biomedical Imaging and Intervention Journal , volume 4 . Abstract Singapore is a small country, but it is ideally and centrally located to conveniently serve not only its population but also patients from the surrounding regions. It’s economy is sufficiently strong to maintain highly sophisticated and expensive equipment to manage a high level of healthcare, including oncology services.Cancer incidences in Singapore are on an upward trend based on the report of the Singapore Cancer Registry for the period of 2001-2005. Cancer is the number one cause of death in Singapore. The three most common cancers for males in Singapore, in decreasing occurrences, are colorectal, lung, and prostate. For females, the three most common cancers are breast, colorectal, lung cancers. Technological advances and advances in anti-cancer drugs have transformed cancer management leading to improved outcomes worldwide and in Singapore as well. The epidemiology and management of these common cancers in Singapore are presented. While Singapore presently has five radiotherapy centres (3 public, 2 private) to service its population of 4.5 million and regional needs, the government has plans to expand its radiotherapy services to accommodate the aging population and the rising expectations of increasingly affluent cancer patients seeking advanced cancer care. The current and future initiatives spearheaded by Singapore to achieve excellence in this aspect are discussed.
description1542=Let us, with Allah's blessed name, embark from my Caribbean island-home in Trinidad, for an exclusive 'southern hemisphere' Islamic lecture-tour that will commence in February 2007 and end one year later in February 2008. This journey will take us through Venezuela and Argentina in South America, Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe in Southern Africa, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in South Asia, to Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore in South-East Asia. We will sometimes have to visit the same country twice. At other times, because of unjust war on Isl?m, we will have to cancel visits to countries such as Australia and New Zealand even though there are large numbers of Muslims awaiting us. And at yet other times the host communities in places such as Fiji Islands and India would themselves decide against hosting a lecture-tour out of fear. And finally we will sorrowfully have to postpone visits to countries such as Iran, Yemen and the city of Hong Kong because of time constraint. I had been resident for ten wonderful years in New York up to the end of September 2001, and I was present at New York's J F Kennedy Airport on that fateful 9/11 morning when the American CIA and the Israeli Mossad jointly planned, attacked and demolished the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in Lower Manhattan and then falsely put the blame for that supreme act of terrorism on Arabs and Muslims. The mysterious and essentially godless Jewish-Christian alliance that now rules the world on behalf of the Euro-Jewish State of Israel may wish to challenge my claim of CIA/Israeli Mossad responsibility for planning and executing the 9/11 terrorist attack on America. They may do so while insisting instead, that the American government is truthful in assigning responsibility, and hence blame, on Arabs and Muslims. In that case I invite them as well as others who are stubbornly of the same view, to come forward that we might jointly pray for the eternal curse of the One God and of His Prophets, on whoever assigns responsibility and blame falsely in this matter. I left New York two weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attack on America to conduct a pre-planned Islamic lecture-tour of South Africa, and then traveled constantly for two years before returning to Trinidad in August 2003. I have never returned to USA since then. The story of those travels was told in my first Islamic Travelogue that was published at the end of 2003. It evoked such a positive response from readers that I decided to sacrifice the time and effort to write this second travelogue for the lecture-tour of 2007-8 even though I have important books to write. May Allah Most Kind grant that this humble effort might inspire at least some of our readers to also leave the comforts of their home and to travel in the noble mission of Islam. Ameen\!

description1540=Mycket av dagens välstånd och skapande av det kräva byggnad eller skaffa kunskap. Om du vill att folk ska veta vilken typ av produkt eller tjänst du säljer, måste du ta dig tid att berätta för dem för att öka sina kunskaper om dig och din produkt. Det enklaste och anses det mest effektiva och lönsamma sättet att göra det nuförtiden är via Internet.

Processen kan vara lite skrämmande vid första för dem som aldrig har tänkt investera i lager på allvar. men när du får tillräcklig kunskap, förtroende ökar som det brukar händer för oss alla. Det är därför djupt blå publikationer hänvisar till den som byggnaden kunskap.

description1531=There is a need for schools to engage students in constructing scientific theories like practicing scientists in order to excel in the 21st century knowledge economy. An approach to engage students in constructing scientific theories is to enculturate students in doing science with language, which differs from the mainstream classroom discourse--talking about science. In terms of doing science with language, young people use language to produce scientific knowledge like practicing scientists. When it comes to talking about science, students learn to master science knowledge constructed by scientists, eventually leading to a positivist epistemology and consumer identity. In this paper, we conceptualize an approach to design science classroom discourse toward doing science and instantiate the conceptualization with a game-based learning program. The result is eight two-hour sessions chemistry program that is revolved around a six-level role-playing computer game--the "Legends of Alkhimia". (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

description1530=This paper distinguishes Bahasa Malaysia (Malaysian language) and Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian language) according to type and function and summarizes their development as the national languages of Malaya, Singapore, and Indonesia. It presents a short, historical account of the spread, through religious and educational activities, of the English language in Malaya and Singapore and the Dutch language in Indonesia. Some instances in which these imposed languages become the languages of political and cultural protest and came into contact with the national languages are described and a tentative assessment of the present position and status of English and Dutch in the three countries is attempted.

description1527="Where has Benoit been hiding? With a debut novel this good, it's hard to believe he hasn't published at least 10 previous books. Every element of this rollicking adventure shines, from its suspenseful, globetrotting plot to its nicely rounded characters. Unlikely young hero Doug Pearce, most recently of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, leaves his small town at the request of Edna, an exotic older woman who knew his black-sheep uncle, Russell Pearce. It seems that Russell was murdered in 1948, apparently while trying to smuggle an outrageously big red diamond out of Singapore. Edna thinks Russell was framed and wants Doug to help clear his uncle's name; he agrees, mainly because he's never been out of the U.S and because Edna is footing the bill. Beginning in Casablanca and continuing through Morocco and Egypt, Doug eventually lands in Singapore, where his uncle's life ended. Along the way, he meets a stately museum curator and a stunning heiress, among other exotic characters, and unwisely trusts both of them. This captivating debut makes great use of a familiar gambit\: throwing a naive, untraveled hero into foreign climes and forcing him to hit the ground running. Readers will eagerly await more from the very talented Benoit."--Booklist

Complemented in some cases by industrial policies, economic planning is a dynamic attempt to change the structure defining parameters and policy mix of an economy. In market based economies ranging from Western Europe to Asia, planning has been practiced since the end of the Second World War as a key developmental tool. Industrial policies have a longer history that could be traced back to at least Alexander Hamilton.^\nAgain, they have been employed in different countries under different forms.  Economic development has still been an ongoing quest and successful economic development is probably needed more than before by many nations, Since 1980s, however, with significant changes in the dynamics of the world economy, economic planning and industrial policy have been less and less discussed in academic and policy circles. As external and domestic conditions have changed so should planning. However, although it continued to be practiced one way or another in many countries, lack of discussion leads to either ‘planning as before’ (being called economic planning or under the disguise of various other tools) or no formal planning. The former is likely to be inadequate or even inappropriate under new surrounding conditions.^\nOn the other hand, economic planning under different forms consists of related but generally uncoordinated developmental tools such as public sector strategic plans, revived forms of physical infrastructure planning, new versions of industrial, technology, innovation, cluster and/or R&D  policies. They are also likely to suffer from ineffective and/or cost-inefficient outcomes as they are generally ad hoc policy responses. On the other hand, it could also be argued that countries which opted or opt for no formal economic planning in fact practice certain aspects of planning this way or that way.^\nOwing to waning interest in economic planning and industrial policy, important questions such as the following, are not receiving the proper attention\: In what ways and areas, are economic planning and industrial policy being conceptualized and implemented in today’s world? Are there still reasonable roles for economic planning in today’s world in assisting nations’ quest towards economic development? What are other tools forming an ecosystem of planning and industrial policy that can help accelerate economic development?This book examines such questions and considers new roles for economic planning, industrial policy and related contemporary tools to support economic development and national competitiveness. Firstly, it broadly discusses national economic planning in terms of the earlier theoretical and practical motivations. Secondly, it looks at selected country experiences with economic planning in restrospect and prospect.^\nThirdly, similarly, it looks at industrial policy in selected countries / regions. Finally, it discusses new economic planning approaches and complementing developmental tools such as learning systems, technology policy, cluster policy and links to regional development\n

description1524=Stimulated by the general philosophical idea oflogical positivism Edgar A. Singer, early in the 1920s made the radical suggestion that behaviour does not have mentalcauses. His thesis, further developed and modified by Arturo Rosenblueth, Norbert Wiener and Julian Bigelow in the early 1940s, has come to be termed behaviouralteleology. The principal motivation for Gerd Sommerhoff was in the beginnings of the 1950s to disjoin the behavioural approach from all notions of mind, mental statesand mental representation. The aim was exc1usively the study extern ally observable stimulus-response behaviour pattems. The present report concentrates solely upon theteleological study ofbehaviour and is the final contribution to the study ofbehaviour from a mechanistic point ofview. Each of the integrated studies has been designed with the purpose to achieve a demonstrative definition of environmental conditions in the simulation of event-action pairs. In particular, the rigorous behaviour position taken in the definition of the concept of "competence" is the result of an application of a "targeted system analysis" as proposed by Sommerhoffin the beginning of 1990. Hence the presented approach has neither a need for the identification of deficiencies nor any use ofMcClelland's concept of "competence", which was based on Murray's "need for achievement" of the 1930s. To overcome obstac1es, to exercise power, to strive to do something difficult as weIl as quickly as possible was Murray's defmition of achievement. But, the defmition in the present artic1e differs from a formal point of viewas well as content-wise from this kind oflogical and psychological behaviourism. The most characteristic features of the developed approach relate to the operating variables, because these are reflecting the experimentally established functions of competition and success within formally defmed limits of perception and action. Both are referring to estimates of "appropriate adaptation", which corresponds to the expression of the distinctive character of citizenship. The cities of Lund in the South ofSweden, Copenhagen in Denmark, and Singapore in the South of East Asia have been ehosen for a description of possible differences concerning the (1)demarcation of perceptual competence and (2) appropriateness in a behavioural response. Both types of differences are indexed as achieved competence.

description1513=Currently, there are only six countries which have the proper tools and equipment and ensured high quality protective devices to know and detect counterfeit medicines from real ones. Needless to say, these countries are power houses in the field of medicine with advanced technology on their side. Of course, the United States is within the list as well as five European countries. With pharmaceutical counterfeiting becoming a serious issue in both developed and developing countries, procurement of these tools is of uttermost importance. It is a big challenge among analytical laboratories to come up with proper tools to accurately detect and characterize medicines. Spectroscopic technique has always been the first method to be used but due to the fact that the number of seized counterfeit medicines has swelled as medicine fraud has become a lucrative business, hence the necessity of risk assessment tools, chromatography is the best and most suitable choice for experts. Reviews have been conducted on the role of chromatography on the vital issue of counterfeiting. It has even been said that Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), World Health Organization (WHO) and other non-profit organizations as well as private pharmaceutical companies have been considering providing chromatographic equipment to countries and cities with high rate of drug smuggling within their boundaries. Among those considered to receive are Bangkok, Thailand’s main airports, Jakarta, Indonesia, Kenya and Beijing, China. In an interview with The Peterson Group , one of the NGOs who signed the petition, the agreement is almost on its last leg of approval. The public can only hope that the process be faster to implementation especially since analysts also stated that counterfeiting, which is an international trade, is already in its permanent growth. Chromatography is one of their solutions to possible stopping of this market. For years, chromatographic techniques have been extensively used in illegal pharmaceutical preparations. When it was only used to detect counterfeit of herbal medicines, it is also found to be accurate in its findings with drugs as well. In the majority of published papers, chromatographic techniques were used for the separation of active ingredients in the samples, to quantify them, to isolate the active ingredients or to detect or identify with mass spectrometry, for example. Chromatographic method includes different technique\: Thin-layer chromatography which is used to identify counterfeits by comparing samples from the fraud and real drugs ; and liquid chromatography is used for target analysis of probable two or more compounds.

description1510=The Oral and Written Communication (OWC) course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic was originally intended to equip students with occupational skills (e.g., report- and letter-writing, public speaking) but has expanded to be a course aimed at helping third-year mechanical engineering students to develop third-year project reports. This has been done through the use of the United Nations Development Project (UNDP) material developed for this purpose by lecturers from Ngee Ann and Singapore Polytechnics and the National University of Singapore. Feedback obtained from the mechanical engineering department indicates that students' project reports have improved\: in a survey conducted at the close of the 1991-92 academic year by the mechanical engineering department, over 85% of the students who had undergone OWC indicated that they had found it useful. A team approach devised by the biotechnology department would reinforce the features of a formal report specific to biotechnology research. (JP)

description1508=A comparative analysis of family policy in various nations looks at state financial support for families and in particular how professional women in academia fare internationally with respect to state support for their families. The analysis includes a review of the general development of family support through the industrial revolution and the 20th century, analysis of family policy in the United States, and a comparative analysis of the family policy of other nations. The comparative analysis notes that, in European countries, family benefits are regarded as a right. Policies are analyzed for the following countries\: Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, Belgium, Zambia, Mozambique, Ghana, India, Singapore, Peoples Republic of China, Chile, Australia, and the United States. The final portion of the analysis examines the positive and negative aspects of state support of the family. Positive aspects found include support for the initial phase of parenting, family solidarity, and equal support to all families. Negative aspects of state support, state intervention in family life, economic costs, discrimination against women; were found to be not compelling. The analysis concludes that the United States should adopt a national family support policy. (Contains 20 references.) (JB)

description1501=There are people whose names are identified with their fields. When an outsider wants to learn about the field of educational technology and enters some keywords, David H. Jonassen is perhaps one the few people whose names will appear instantly. Of course, this is not without reasons. David H. Jonassen has produced enormous amount of work addressing both major and trendy issues in the field of educational technology over the years. His name appears on some of the milestone work in our field. Moreover, I think it is not an exaggeration to say that he is an academic trend setter too. David H. Jonassen has produced at least 37 books, 180 journal articles, 64 book chapters, 12 book reviews, 136 invited presentations, and 282 conference papers. He has supervised 27 doctoral dissertations; most of his advisees were international students. He has provided educational consultancy services in countries such as United States, Brazil, Australia, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Singapore, Canada, Netherlands, and Italy. He has also been active in professional organizations like AECT, AERA, ASTD, and NSPI. Throughout his academic career, he has received about two dozens of awards including but not limited to outstanding publication awards, distinguished development awards, outstanding practice awards, distinguished service awards, and lifetime achievement awards for excellence. Almost all of these awards were given by well-known professional organizations in the field of educational technology. I am sure there is more about him but these are preliminary outcomes of my speedy search. Considering his milestone contributions and eye-opening discussions in our field along with the worldwide recognition he has among colleagues, we decided to interview Professor Jonassen for this issue of Contemporary Educational Technology. As usual, we conducted the interview through communication technologies in several rounds of exchanging questions, answers, and elaborations. I think the interview has a number of enlightening messages for all, particularly for young colleagues.

description1494=This paper aims to give partner states of the European Training Foundation material to help them assess the potential value of targets as a tool for reform. It begins with a definition of terms and a brief statement of the potential benefits of target setting. The 10 potential benefits are as follows\: provide a focus for planning and action; test the realism of aims and objectives; motivate people to improve performance; harness effort; enable measurement of progress and corrective management action; constitute the basis for detailed work and time plans; promote transparency; increase accountability; add to the basis for evaluation; and offer measurable outputs in return for the resources invested. The paper discusses each benefit and some practical problems arising from the use of targets, illustrating the discussion where possible with examples from real experience. The next section addresses regional and sectoral targets, leading to a short statement on how targets might be relevant to the partner states. A discussion follows of the requirements for the effective introduction and use of targets and suggestions as to how states might proceed if not all those requirements are in place. The paper ends with a passage on conclusions and some proposals for possible future work. Appendixes include country reports that report on the country's vocational education and training system. These countries are included\: Australia; France; Hungary; Poland; Romania; Singapore; United Kingdom; and United States. (Contains 19 references.) (YLB)

description1492=Sparks Corporation - There aren’t a tonne of funds focused on seed-stage funding worldwide, but we can add a new one to the list today. SparkLabs, the company behind the accelerator program in Korea, is expanding its scope with its first seed-stage fund that will “help great startups go global.” Not only will the SparksLab Global fund – which has a total kitty of $30 million — zoom in on seed-stage investments, in addition to the early stage focus of its accelerator, but it will have a far broader global remit. The fund will invest across Asia, Europe, Israel and the US, going beyond the accelerator program’s primary focus on Korea and the US — although it does accept startups from other parts of the world. The caliber of its founding team is impressive. Bernard Moon, co-founder and General Partner at SparkLabs, will be a primary operating partner alongside Net Jacobsson — who was Facebook’s first international executive and has advised Openfeint, Crowdstar and King.com — and Frank Meehan — formerly of Horizons Ventures, who has worked with Spotify, Siri, Summly and others.

These tips hopes to help job seekers from Australia who wishes to work in Southeast Asian countries such as Jakarta Indonesia, KL Malaysia, Beijing China, Singapore and many more.   During almost every job interview, the interviewer will at one point ask someone trying to find a job what their biggest weaknesses are. While it can seem like a harrowing question, there's more to gain by taking responsibility and answering the question honestly than trying to avoid it, and working to own the situation can have long-term benefits.
description1490=Higher education in Australia contributed almost $3 billion to the Australian economy in 2000 and education has become an essential source of export profits. Australia now provides university places for over six per cent of the global student population. However, there is little empirical research undertaken in that domain. The research underpinning this paper addresses this problem by focusing on students from Singapore, which represent an overseas student client group of Asia. It sets out to explore personal, environmental and behavioural factors that influence educational decisions of students from Singapore, and to build a model that represents the complex interaction of factors and processes involved. While a built model is the major objective, the focus of this paper is on one component, the two interpretive, in-depth case studies. These present an interpretive phenomenological perspective that represents the complexity of individual experiences and supplements the quantitative research and building of a descriptive decision-making model.

description1489=This paper examines some of the complexities involved in the actual work of classroom instruction by examining interactions among the goals of teaching. The research is part of a case study of teaching a Year 7 Singapore class comprising students of average mathematical ability. Among the complexities of teaching analysed here are the problems associated with trying to fulfill the multiple goals of teaching and the conflict experienced by the teacher as he attempts to carry out these goals. This provides insight into how a teacher performs the act of balancing different goals while carrying out instruction in class. The implications of these insights into teaching practice for the wider education community are also discussed. (Contains 3 figures and 1 table.)

description1487=This paper presents an overview of the English teaching situation in Asia, with particular emphasis on Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Republic of China, Singapore, and Thailand. A distinction is drawn between ESL countries, in which English instruction begins at the elementary level and is frequently used as the medium for other subjects (Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore), and EFL countries, in which English is taught as a foreign language, usually beginning at the secondary level, and where the medium of instruction is the national language (Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of China, and Thailand). The common objectives of English instruction are\: (1) helping students to develop cultural awareness of people in countries where English is a native language, (2) helping students see the necessity of studying English as a medium of international communication, (3) enabling students to use English for communication, (4) developing the desire to increase one's knowledge of English, and (5) enabling students to continue study at higher levels of education. Unofficial objectives include enabling students to pass college and university entrance exams, and enhancing employment possibilities. Problems in the areas of teacher training, teaching methods, and materials development make for large discrepancies between these objectives and the actual situation. (CLK)

description1485=EMERGENCY RESPONSE BEST PRACTICES \: \: PROTECTION AGAINST HYPOTHERMIA Low ambient temperature and wind chill may simply be part of the job in cold climates, but they can have a lethal effect on exposed skin – particularly when combined with hazardous conditions where safety showers are required. This problematic combination creates a scenario for an ineffective and injurious emergency shower response. In some cases, inappropriate safety equipment can actually speed up the potential for cold-temperature related injuries like hypothermia. To ensure everyone’s safety, awareness and adherence to proper procedures and safety standards is critical. UNDERSTANDING COLD-TEMP RELATED INJURY RISKS Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) defines hypothermia as a cold-temp related injury in which normal body temperature drops to or below 95°F/35°C. Symptoms include drowsiness or fatigue, bluish skin, uncontrollable shivering, slurred speech and clumsy movements. Permanent tissue damage and death can result if hypothermia is left untreated. EXPOSED FLESH in 0°F/17.8°C with 10mph wind speed is in danger of hypothermia within 1-minute Specific conditions in cold-weather climates can increase the risk of cold-temp related injuries, including hypothermia, which can affect a person even when land temperatures are above freezing or water temperatures are below 98.6oF/37oC. Factors influencing these injuries include\: • Low ambient temperatures and/or wind chill • Wet skin, which freezes at a higher temperature than dry skin • Exposed skin While the ANSI Z358.1 Standard outlines suitable water temperatures as tepid – with a defined range of 60 to 100°F/15.5 to 37.77°C – and requires a full 15-minute drench period, the low end of this accepted temperature range can exacerbate the effects of hypothermia, particularly when exposure lasts the entire drench period. In addition, ANSI Z358.1 Appendix B6 states\: Colder ambient temperatures might require an enclosure for added protection – even with water supplied in the ANSI Z358.1 specified temperature range, there is a high risk of hypothermia for wet victims exposed to frigid ambient temperatures where loss of body heat is intensified by the effects of evaporative cooling and wind chill. It is crucial that the proper safety shower system is provided to prevent an incident where hypothermia could intensify an injury to a victim already in a hazardous situation. SAFETY SOLUTIONS FOR COLD-WEATHER CLIMATES Haws Integrated™ offers a variety of customized, ANSI compliant enclosed safety solutions for all climates. Features specific to equipment intended for use in cold-weather climates include combination units enclosed in booths with all-weather insulation, water-proof exterior coating, self-closing shower doors, built-in heaters, internal hot water supply and medically superior, non-injurious water flow, all of which qualify as industry best practices. Enclosures eliminate frigid environments by providing a shower area at a safe ambient temperature, out of the elements. Properly preparing a site for the use of climate specific equipment can mean the difference in minimizing or increasing the severe effects of cold-temperature injuries.

description1483=This article is from BMC Infectious Diseases , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: Influenza infections may result in different clinical presentations. This study aims to determine the clinical differences between circulating influenza strains in a young healthy adult population in the tropics. Methods\: A febrile respiratory illness (FRI) (fever ≥ 37.5°C with cough and/or sore throat) surveillance program was started in 4 large military camps in Singapore on May 2009. Personnel with FRI who visited the camp clinics from 11 May 2009 to 25 June 2010 were recruited. Nasal washes and interviewer-administered questionnaires on demographic information and clinical features were obtained from consenting participants. All personnel who tested positive for influenza were included in the study. Overall symptom load was quantified by counting the symptoms or signs, and differences between strains evaluated using linear models. Results\: There were 434 (52.9%) pandemic H1N1-2009, 58 (7.1%) seasonal H3N2, 269 (32.8%) influenza B, and 10 (1.2%) seasonal H1N1 cases. Few seasonal influenza A (H1N1) infections were detected and were therefore excluded from analyses, together with undetermined influenza subtypes (44 (1.5%)), or more than 1 co-infecting subtype (6 (0.2%)). Pandemic H1N1-2009 cases had significantly fewer symptoms or signs (mean 7.2, 95%CI 6.9-7.4, difference 1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.0, p < 0.001) than the other two subtypes (mean 8.7, 95%CI 8.5-9.0). There were no statistical differences between H3N2 and influenza B (p \= 0.58). Those with nasal congestion, rash, eye symptoms, injected pharynx or fever were more likely to have H3N2; and those with sore throat, fever, injected pharynx or rhinorrhoea were more likely to have influenza B than H1N1-2009. Conclusions\: Influenza cases have different clinical presentations in the young adult population. Pandemic H1N1 influenza cases had fewer and milder clinical symptoms than seasonal influenza. As we only included febrile cases and had no information on the proportion of afebrile infections, further research is needed to confirm whether the relatively milder presentation of pandemic versus seasonal influenza infections applies to all infections or only febrile illnesses.
description1482=This paper outlines the market developments, governmental promotion policies, and efforts by private industries for online database services in Japan since the late 1970s. The combination of these efforts over the years has resulted in an online database service market of US$20 billion annually, of which approximately one third is Western online services. Growth in the conventional database service market leveled off in the early 1990s, partly because of the general economic stagnation and partly because of rapid and profound change in the environment for information usage. New opportunities have been provided by the changes in computer usage as a result of corporate downsizing trends, rapid progress in multimedia and digital technology, wide-spread information networks--especially the Internet, and a steadily emerging personal and home market. Experimental programs for digital libraries have already started. The idea of end-user searches of digital libraries through a network is exciting but threatening for everyone in the online services industry. In addition to Japan, online database producers and vendors are now emerging in newly industrializing countries and areas in Asia such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia. The market has started to grow, and within a decade the fourth largest market for online services will be in Asia, after the American, European, and Japanese markets. (Author/SWC)
description1481=This is a study on the impact of culture on the leadership of Mexican principals facing political and socioeconomic pressures. The research is a continuation of an international study engaging researchers from 8 countries\: Thailand, China, UK, Norway, Singapore, Norway, Brazil, U.S., and Mexico. The twelve high school principals who participated in this preliminary study are all from the Southeast of Mexico. Hofstede's theoretical framework was used to examine the relationship of the principals with authorities and with groups, the concepts of masculinity and femininity, and the ways of dealing with uncertainty and conflict. The framework provided some insights of the interplay between culture and leadership, but it was limited for explaining the complexities of principals' roles. Ethnic diversity and the socioeconomic and political context appeared to have more influence in the behavior of the principals than their perceptions of their roles.

The Metro operations are very different from long haul train operations in that, the trains run at a higher frequency, sometimes as frequent as every few minutes during peak hours which necessitates constant monitoring of trains on the track to avoid incidents and bottlenecks. MWI’s Rail Communications HUB (RailHUB) is a 2nd generation dispatcher solution that acts as the via media for all types of real-time communication with the trains and stations including Passenger Emergency comms, Passenger Announcements & Displays, Driver Comms and Train status and alerts when the trains are on revenue run as well as when the trains are at the depots. In short, RailHUB is a critical component in managing day-to-day operations of a Metro rail network. This product has been successfully deployed on a few metros in the Asian region. Police HUB Traditional Police operations involve the field force carrying private analog radios and the control centre operators keeping track of the various groups through just voice communication. The modern police force is no longer constrained by just voice comms through private analog radios but in fact has multi-mode of communication using private Trunked Radio(such as TETRA) as the primary communications medium as well as using other public telephony networks to have voice, data and video feeds. The control centre dispatcher thus has a powerful system to keep track of the police field force and to keep the entire force constantly updated with necessary information using multiple channels of communication. MWI’s PoliceHUB is an integrated voice, data and video dispatcher that provides intuitive dispatching capability to communicate with the police force during critical / emergency operations. It caters for multiple communication infrastructure and mechanism. Automatic Location Tracking System (ALTS) One of the key components of the TelematicsHUB, this product forms the backbone of managing day-to-day operations by tracking the fleet on the roads. The ALTS not only has the standard features of any tracking solution but also provides for advanced features to aid emergency operations.
description1475=This article is from BMC Psychiatry , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: East Asian countries have high suicide rates. However, little is known about clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with suicidality in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) from six Asian countries. Methods\: The study cohort consisted of 547 outpatients with MDD. Patients presented to study sites in China (n \= 114), South Korea (n \= 101), Malaysia (n \= 90), Singapore (n \= 40), Thailand (n \= 103), and Taiwan (n \= 99). All patients completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Global Severity Index(SCL-90R), the Fatigue Severity Scale, the 36-item short-form health survey, the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Patients were classified as showing high suicidality if they scored ≥6 on the MINI suicidality module. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine sociodemographic and clinical factors related to high suicidality. Results\: One hundred and twenty-five patients were classed as high suicidality. Unemployed status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.43, p 
description1474=This article is from ZooKeys . Abstract AbstractThe photosymbiotic ascidian fauna at Changi Beach, Pulau Semakau, Sentosa and St. John’s Island, Singapore were surveyed. A total of five species, Diplosoma simile, Lissoclinum bistratum, Lissoclinum punctatum, Lissoclinum timorense and Trididemnum cyclops, were recorded, with Lissoclinum timorense and Trididemnum cyclops being newly recorded in Singapore. However, no photosymbiotic species were found at Changi Beach probably due to the polluted waters in the region. Coastal development has caused Singapore waters to become turbid, leading to decrease in suitable habitats for photosymbiotic ascidians. Clean waters in Pulau Semakau probably provide a better environment for the growth of photosymbiotic ascidians and this area has a greater variety of these ascidians than the other areas in Singapore. Each of the five species has also been recorded in the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan) and three species (Diplosoma simile, Lissoclinum bistratum and Trididemnum cyclops) have also been recorded in Taiwan.

description1470=The Teacher Education Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M) 2008 is the first cross-national study to provide data on the knowledge that future primary and lower-secondary school teachers acquire during their mathematics teacher education. It is also the first major study to examine variations in the nature and influence of teacher education programs within and across countries. The impetus for TEDS-M, conducted in 17 countries under the aegis of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), was recognition that teaching mathematics in primary and secondary schools has become more challenging worldwide as knowledge demands change and large numbers of teachers reach retirement age. It has also become increasingly clear that effectively responding to demands for teacher preparation reform will remain difficult while there is lack of consensus on what such reform should encompass and while the range of alternatives continues to be poorly understood let alone based on evidence of what works. TEDS-M accordingly focused on collecting, from the varied national and cultural settings represented by the participating countries, empirical data that could inform policy and practice related to recruiting and preparing a new generation of teachers capable of teaching increasingly demanding mathematics curricula. Two particular purposes underpinned this work. The first was to identify how the countries participating in TEDS-M prepare teachers to teach mathematics in primary and lower-secondary schools. The second was to study variation in the nature and impact of teacher education programs on mathematics teaching and learning within and across the participating countries. The key research questions for the study focused on the relationships between teacher education policies, institutional practices, and future-teachers' mathematics content knowledge and mathematics pedagogy knowledge. The 17 countries that participated in TEDS-M were Botswana, Canada (four provinces), Chile, Chinese Taipei, Georgia, Germany, Malaysia, Norway, Oman (lower-secondary teacher education only), the Philippines, Poland, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain (primary teacher education only), Switzerland (German-speaking cantons), Thailand, and the United States of America (public institutions only). Appended are\: (1) Supplementary Exhibits Relating to Chapters 3, 4, 6, and 7; (2) Sampling, Scaling, and Reporting Procedures; and (3) Organizations and Individuals Responsible for TEDS-M. Individual sections contain exhibits, footnotes and references.

description1468=Given the current international context of instability and uncertainty, we were driven by the desire to utilize a digital game to cut across the complexity of public policy, so as to educate our young with the experience and deep learning to be appreciative, accountable and proactive citizens of a globalized world. Having developed a curriculum that synthesizes technology, philosophy and pedagogy, we began our iterations of exploration with Singapore public schools. Through our project, we wanted to share our idea that the learning of public policy, in the form of Singapore's Social Studies curriculum, was disadvantaged with the traditional, transmission-oriented mode of education, and had to be experienced and performed. Data from the impactful dialogic sessions conducted showed that students experienced realistically the problems faced in public policy decision making, and gained a sense of what governance, learnt performatively entailed.

description1466=This paper describes a community service program in Singapore that involves voluntary mentoring, focusing on its impact upon adolescent girls. The paper highlights some of the ways in which community service providers come together to exchange ideas and practices to build up the social and emotional capacities of adolescent girls. After discussing issues related to female adolescent development, the tendency toward decline in self-esteem and academic achievement as they enter adolescence, and the need for resilience to keep them functioning when confronted with low self-esteem, the paper focuses on Singapore's volunteer mentoring program for adolescent girls. The program involves mentors who are over the age of 16 years who work with girls in upper elementary and lower secondary school. Set up by the Singapore government, the program involves 22 members representing various relevant government ministries, statutory boards, and major youth organizations. The paper provides examples of different mentoring programs in Singapore and discusses research on the mentoring experience. It concludes by explaining that the mentoring program benefits both mentees and mentors, noting problems within the program, and describing training workshops for female mentors. (SM)

description1464=This article is from JMIR mHealth and uHealth , volume 2 . Abstract Background\: The application of telemedicine has been described for its use in medical training and education, management of stroke patients, urologic surgeries, pediatric laparoscopic surgeries, clinical outreach, and the field of orthopedics. However, the usefulness of a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform has not been well described. Objective\: A pilot study was conducted to implement a health insurance portability and accountability act (HIPAA) compliant form of communication between doctors in an orthopedic clinical setting and determine their reactions to MyDoc, a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform. Methods\: By replacing current methods of communication through various mobile applications and text messaging services with MyDoc over a six week period, we gained feedback and determined user satisfaction with this innovative system from questionnaires handed to the program director, program coordinator, one trauma consultant, all orthopedic residents, and six non-orthopedic residents at the National University Hospital in Singapore. Results\: Almost everyone who completed the questionnaire strongly agreed that MyDoc should replace current systems of peer to peer communication in the hospital. The majority also felt that the quality of images, videos, and sound were excellent. Almost everyone agreed that they could communicate easily with each other and would feel comfortable doing so routinely. The majority felt that virtual consults through MyDoc should be made available to inpatients as well as outpatients to potentially lessen clinic loads and provide a secure manner in which patients can communicate with their primary teams any time convenient to both. It was also agreed by most that the potential of telerounding had advantages, especially on weekends as a supplement to normal rounds. Conclusions\: Potential uses of MyDoc in an orthopedic clinical setting include HIPAA-compliant peer to peer communication, clinical outreach in the setting of trauma, supervision in the operating room or watching procedures being performed remotely, providing both patient and parent reassurance in pediatric orthopedic patients, and finally in the setting of outpatient clinics. With our pilot study having excellent results in terms of acceptance and satisfaction, the integration of a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform, not only in the orthopedic department but also the hospital in general, has an exciting and limitless potential. More so in this era where downsizing hospital costs is beneficial, doing so may also be mandatory in order to comply with the soon to be introduced personal data protection act.

description1460=This article is from International Journal of General Medicine , volume 7 . Abstract The burden of disease associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in adults can be considerable but is largely preventable through routine vaccination. Although substantial progress has been made with the recent licensure of the new vaccines for prevention of pneumonia in adults, vaccine uptake rates need to be improved significantly to tackle adult pneumococcal disease effectively. Increased education regarding pneumococcal disease and improved vaccine availability may contribute to a reduction in pneumococcal disease through increased vaccination rates. The increase in the elderly population in Singapore as well as globally makes intervention in reducing pneumococcal disease an important priority. Globally, all adult vaccines remain underused and family physicians give little priority to pneumococcal vaccination for adults in daily practice. Family physicians are specialists in preventive care and can be leaders in ensuring that adult patients get the full benefit of protection against vaccine-preventable diseases. They can play a key role in the immunization delivery of new and routine vaccines by educating the public on the risks and benefits associated with vaccines. Local recommendations by advisory groups on vaccination in adults will also help to tackle vaccine preventable diseases in adults.

description1454=While education systems from nation to nation differ significantly according to national character and local requirements, developments in public policy initiatives regarding the use of technology in schools have followed similar patterns among nations as diverse as the United States, Great Britain, Denmark, Italy, Viet Nam, Germany, France, Singapore, Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. This paper is based on participant observations in international meetings, collaborations, consultations, project planning, and negations, supported by key document reviews. It is postulated that the commonalities in such initiatives stem from the emergence of a global digital economy and society, and that education reform has taken on an unprecedented global character, regardless of initial status of an educational system, as a consequence. It is further postulated that the commonalities are the product of a reactive approach to educational reform, that rational decision-making has been inadequately applied to public policy and instructional decision-making, and that the issues not yet addressed promise to pose significant impediments to getting an adequate return on the broad investments in information and communications technology among the various nations. Appendices include a meetings and informants list and an overview of international grant sites for the IBM Reinventing Education Program. (Author/MES)

description1451=Drawings on a set subject by Singaporean children were analyzed for correspondence with, or deviation from, the 14 categories used by Elliot Eisner in his 1967 study "A Comparison of the Developmental Drawing Characteristics of Culturally Advantaged and Culturally Disadvantaged Children." Masami Toku's 20 Categories of Spatial Treatment in Children's Drawings was also applied. The study sought to ascertain the incidence and type(s) of universal schema and the possible presence of any localized sociocultural influences. Data were gathered from a 200-strong sample of Secondary Two students (average age was 14) at a Singapore single-sex (boys) autonomous state school, which admits students of above-average academic ranking. The majority of the students were ethnically Chinese, with ethnically Malay and Indian also represented. Students were asked to make two drawings with a 2B pencil, each drawing to be completed in a 30-minute period. A Singaporean modified version of the Clark-Garen Drawing Instrument was used for evaluation. The results are discussed. (BT)
description1450=This study examines the relationship between the typical activities and social involvement young children experience in Singapore day care centers and the children's language development. Cognitive, physical and domestic activities and social involvement were observed in 16 day care centers and recorded using the Target Child Method of Observation. A comparison of these activities was then made between centers that exhibited "high progress" and "low progress" in language development. The findings showed that children in Singapore child care centers spent a majority of their time in adult-led teaching sessions, and in cognitive and domestic activities. Centers that exhibited high language development had children who were more occupied with cognitive activities and fine and gross motor activities than other activities; these children were also found in small groups. The high-progress centers also exhibited more incidence of verbal interaction with peers and adults. (JPB)

description1444=Prior to 1960 vocational and technical education in Singapore received little attention. After Singapore attained self-government in 1959, a policy of diversification to accelerate economic growth through industrialization was adopted. The emphasis then shifted to technical education and training. In 1964 there was a significant move towards the establishment of secondary vocational schools and the first vocational institute was initiated; the secondary vocational schools were later phased out in favor of vocational institutes. The Industrial Training Board (ITB) was created in 1973 to centralize, coordinate, and intensify industrial training. The ITB and the Adult Education Board established in 1960 were merged into a single national authority responsible for vocational training--the Vocational and Industrial Training Board. The significant factors that have impinged upon the trend of vocational training have been the limited human resources, the New Education System of 1980, and the strategy of high economic growth based on industrial restructuring. Recent developments and major efforts to consolidate the training system have been the expansion of training capacity, refinement of the training system, and upgrading of the existing work force. Four tables and four figures are appended that depict full- and part-time enrollment, apprentice registration, and organizational structures in the educational system. (YLB)

In past the economic relations between the two countries were not remained appreciating and Pakistan faced a severe trade deficit.                                In the beginning of 21st century Pakistan and China realized the importance of strong economic ties, yet both countries revised the trade policy and Pakistan was given much favor to export several types of goods into Chinese market.                                                In current scenario the strategic importance is based on how much the countries are engaged in Trade. It brings not only economic prosperity but also brings peace and stability in the region. China will benefit by using Gawader seaport in Pakistan, which will be the shortest transit for Chinese goods to enter into Gulf states, Europe and Africa as well, on the other hand huge foreign investment by Chinese firms in Pakistan will also push the overall economic condition.

description1424=This article is from BMC Cancer , volume 13 . Abstract Background\: Global hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences is believed to occur early in tumorigenesis. There is a great interest in identifying factors that contribute to global DNA hypomethylation and associated cancer risk. We tested the hypothesis that plasma S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) level alone or in combination with genetic variation in DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B) was associated with global DNA methylation extent at long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) sequences. Methods\: Plasma SAM level and LINE-1 DNA methylation index were measured using stored blood samples collected from 440 healthy Singaporean Chinese adults during 1994-1999. Genetic polymorphisms of 13 loci in DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B were determined. Results\: LINE-1 methylation index was significantly higher in men than in women (p \= 0.001). LINE-1 methylation index was positively associated with plasma SAM levels (p ≤ 0.01), with a plateau at approximately 78% of LINE-1 methylation index (55 nmol/L plasma SAM) in men and 77% methylation index (50 nmol/L plasma SAM) in women. In men only, the T allele of DNMT1 rs21124724 was associated with a statistically significantly higher LINE-1 methylation index (ptrend \= 0.001). The DNMT1 rs2114724 genotype modified the association between plasma SAM and LINE-1 methylation index at low levels of plasma SAM in men. Conclusions\: Circulating SAM level was associated with LINE-1 methylation status among healthy Chinese adults. The DNMT1 genetic polymorphism may exert a modifying effect on the association between SAM and LINE-1 methylation status in men, especially when plasma SAM level is low. Our findings support a link between plasma SAM and global DNA methylation status at LINE-1 sequences.

description1420=Aztec Group has been in the real estate banking for three decades; but it has also done a lot in providing service in the development and construction sector, whichever type of property we are talking about\: apartments, office buildings, industrial complexes, shopping malls, self-storage and hospitality buildings.   Understanding the criteria needed in the right approach to investing in these particular projects, is an expertise that Aztec has acquired through many years of experience. And so it is with having the due diligence required by their entrepreneurial and institutional clients.   How does Aztec accomplish this?   A company engaged in the real estate works within an environment of rapid change and innovation. Construction and infrastructure development, in general, have transformed the face of the globe, particularly in the urban areas. This is not to mention the large-scale civil work projects undertaken by institutional organizations involved in delivering essential utility needs, such as power, water supply, transportation and communication. Without keeping abreast with the innovations and future trends that these sectors undergo or will undergo, a company like Aztec will not be able to serve its clients faithfully and efficiently.   The simple innovations in communication and information technology require certain adaptations in the physical design of homes and buildings that will house not just people but also the equipment and facilitites that will incorporate the technology. And we have not even talked about the essential types of materials and innovative designs now available because of the need to make structures sustainable and friendly to the environment.   That is why Aztec has kept its position as an innovator by seeing the opportunities on behalf of their clients even before they become apparent to both their clients and their competitors. Whereas telecommunication gadgets are rapidly changing to keep in step with the fast-changing needs of consumers and the application of newly-discovered technology, Aztec recognizes the importance of likewise finding ways to incorporate new ideas, new designs and new technology into the real estate and development industry. This is the only way it can honestly claim that it has delivered the best possible service to its clients.   True, every company seeks to achieve that goal of satisfying clients' needs. However, only those which have the initiative and foresight to incorporate the subtle and unseen changes in the industry can fully comprehend the best manner in which clients will be served beyond their expectations.   Service in the real estate has grown rapidly not just in volume with the corresponding population growth but also in terms of the efficiency as well as the innovativeness required by discriminating clients. With decreasing costs of materials to replace traditional materials, such as concrete, steel and lumber, which are equally or even more durable and, more importantly, easier and less costly to install and maintain, consumers and institutional users are gradually choosing to follow the trends toward innovative and economical choices.   Along with these changes in the real estate and construction industry also come innovations in management, disposal, rental and maintenance of properties. Aztec makes sure that it will serve its clients by continually updating its expertise and capabilities along every significant aspect of the industry.

description1415=The case of Singapore illustrates how well-deployed information technology (IT) can be a change agent in education and national development. IT has been a catalyst and enabler of the shift from didactic, passive instruction to interactive, learner-centered and learner-directed instruction. In technical education in particular, IT has served as a new tool/facility, valuable educational resource, integral component of education and training, and stimulant and vehicle of knowledge creation. IT has facilitated infrastructure development and economic growth both directly and indirectly via education. Of 55 major cities surveyed worldwide, Singapore ranked fourth in computer and Internet usage. Singapore's IT 2000 Masterplan calls for establishing a host of multimedia services at competitive rates. Along with thinking skills development and national education, IT is one of the three priorities for Singapore's education plan, which calls for having 30% of the curriculum incorporate IT by 2002. IT has significantly improved the following aspects of Singapore's educational delivery system\: administration; presentation; and communication. There are strong indications of a causal relationship between deployment of IT and significant improvements in Singapore's educational system and economy. Factors credited with Singapore's successful assimilation of IT include the following\: goal definition, leadership/management, ownership, infrastructural provisions, training, incentives, and monitoring and evaluation.

description1413=Keeley Consulting Group nylig gjennomført noen vurderinger om politikkutvikling . Det viser seg at en organisasjon skal konstruere en klart definert og nøye skrevet politikk for å sikre en hyggelig, oppmuntrende, organisert, trygg og upartiske arbeidsplass. I utgangspunktet, mange av oss liker ikke en inkonsekvent og inkonsekvent brukt politikk. De føre ofte til mer problemer oppå ble utformet for å løse. Men er politikk en viktig del av enhver organisasjon. De definerer nødvendig retningslinjene for selskaper å drive skikkelig og påvirke oppførselen til individer til et bestemt resultat. Vurder følgende tips gitt av Keeley Consulting Group på hvordan å utvikle ny politikk for organisasjonen. Først, se til at det finnes en policy om politikk. Vi vet at det høres litt overflødig, men det er nødvendig å arbeide i et forhåndsdefinert og besluttet rammeverk selv om det gjelder politikk. Sannsynligvis er det første og viktigste trinnet i modning politikk å gjøre en enkel policy på policyer som klargjør organisasjonens prosessen for å opprette nye policyer. Denne policyen bør bestå av veiledning om hva situasjoner utgjør behovet for en ny politikk, formatet som nye retningslinjer bør bruke, samt prosessen som må følges for en ny policy godkjennes. Det er en stor mulighet at du har en stor inkonsekvens i resultatene og inkonsekvens i etableringen hvis du ikke har en prosess og ramme rundt politikkutforming. Dette kan også resultere i dårlig eller vanskelig håndheving. Andre identifisere eventuelle overlapp med eksisterende policyer. Du må sjekke grundig hvis policyen du planlegger å opprette allerede finnes, eller det deler av den finnes i andre retningslinjer før du oppretter en ny policy. Hvis det er tilfelle, kan du vurdere å endre eksisterende policyer i stedet for å opprette en ny. Tredje ikke Opprett policyen i et vakuum. Keeley Consulting Group antyder at politikk bør utvikles med innspill fra de som påvirkes av dem heller enn sitter bak pulten og gjøre politikken som du følte var nødvendig og som ble utviklet helt på egenhånd. Det er viktig at alle interessenter bli hørt for å redusere muligheten for utilsiktede konsekvenser, selv om den endelige politikken til slutt ikke gjenspeiler alle meninger. Retningslinjer må absolutt være fullført og ekstra meninger kan bidra til å lukke hull som kan eksistere. Fjerde gå tilbake og tenke på behovet. Husk at du bør opprette policyer når det er et klart behov og en løs problemet for å løse, ikke bare fordi noen gjorde noe du ikke liker. Ifølge Keeley Consulting Group gjennomgang, enkelte policyer ble satt på plass av trass og hevn, og denne typen aktivitet skje ikke i en fornuftig organisasjon. Det vil også skje i et firma som har en streng politikk på politikk, som policyen vil ofte gå gjennom flere nivåer for godkjenning. Femte, gjøre bruk av de riktige ordene så det blir ingen misforståelser. Sørg for at du vil bruke enkel og bestemt terminologi fordi politikk bør lett forstås å være effektive. Vi angitt nedenfor noen viktige tips\: -Bruke ordene "må" eller "vil" i stedet for bør"" i kroppen av policyen. Hvis noe er valgfritt, bruke ordet "bør", men ikke når det er et krav. -Bruk en avdeling, office, enhet, eller jobbtittel stedet navnet på en person. -Kontakt e-post må være en generell avdeling-adresse eller en web-side som gir ytterligere kontaktinformasjon. Vennligst unngå bruk av en individuell e-postadresse for å unngå policyen fra trenger oppdateringer når personellendringer skjer. -Ikke understreke deloverskrifter eller ord som skal være understreket i en setning. Sett i stedet deloverskrifter fet eller kursiv hvis et ord har understrekes. Hvis policyen posteres online, kan understrekede ord forveksles med hyperkoblinger. Sjette ta et unntak prosess når det er mulig. I de fleste tilfeller er det et unntak for hver regel. Det er mye lettere å identifisere hvordan et unntak prosessen er å operere på forhånd før policyen er implementert. Vær oppmerksom på at unntak må gis på en måte som er rettferdig og rimelig. Hele politikken kan kalles inn spørsmålet hvis du var uforsiktig med unntak prosessen. Syvende, la noen gråtoner. Keeley Consulting Group mener at noen retningslinjer å forlate litt uskarpt å lage avgjørelser. Det er greit hvis politikk forlater litt grå slik at en person kan gjøre en on-the-fly beslutning. Åttende, definere politikk vedlikehold ansvar. De fleste retningslinjer krever regelmessig gjennomgang å sikre deres fortsatte anvendelighet. Sørg for at du alltid identifisere kontoret som er ansvarlig for policyen fordi noen trenger å kunne gi oppklarende informasjon når spørsmål reist om policyen. Identifiser ikke enkeltpersoner siden de kommer og går. Til slutt, konfigurere policyen bibliotek med versjonskontroll. I dag finnes det flere verktøy som lar deg lagre forskjellige versjoner av dokumenter. Alle ansatte som skal tilgang alle aktuelle policyer hele tiden. Versjonskontroll kan også hjelpe enkeltpersoner å se historien av policyen til å spore hva som er endret gjennom årene.

description1412=This paper explores the role of one cognitive style, spatial visualization, which research suggests correlates highly with student achievement. The study focuses on\: whether students with high, average, and low spatial visualization ability differ in their preferred learning modes (concrete experience, abstract conceptualization, reflective observation, and active experimentation); whether these three groups of spatial visualization ability differ in their perception and processing dimensions; whether these three groups differ in their preferred learning styles (assimilator, converger, accommodator, and diverger); and what the relationship is between learning styles and brain hemisphericity. Three instruments (Kolb's Learning Style Inventory, McCarthy's Hemispheric Mode Indicator, and Dailey's Spatial Visualization Test) were administered to 192 students enrolled in a training center in Singapore. Statistical analyses revealed that students do not differ significantly in their learning modes and hemispheric preference across the three spatial visualization ability groups. Results also indicate that there are no significant differences in learning style preferences from the three brain dominance groups. The general patterns are not consistent with earlier research studies. (Contains 23 references.) (Author/SM)

description1410=This paper examines the worldviews of Singapore students, comprised of Chinese, Malays, and Indians, and explores students' perceptions of and preference for counseling approaches. A modified version of Ibrahim and Kahn's Scale to Assess World Views (1994) was used to assess 970 Secondary Four students' worldviews with the independent variables being gender, age, ethnic group, religion, course of study, academic stream, home language, and socio-economic status. It states that people's worldview influences the kind of counseling they seek. This was evident from the quantitative data that determined that most students' worldview was optimistic and they preferred a relational approach to counseling. The client-centered approach was preferred, with its emphasis on trust-building, respect, and relationship development. Task orientation is reflective of the pessimistic worldview and was found to be the secondary worldview of students. Students with this worldview preferred a more structured approach to counseling such as the cognitive approach. (JDM)

description1407=A 1/6-full-size model of the hull of the British Singapore IIC flying boat was tested in the NACA tank. The results are given in the form of charts and are compared with the results of previous tests made in the NACA tank of a 1/12-full-size model, published in NACA T.N. No. 580, and with the results of tests made in the British R.A.E. tank of another 1/6-full-size model of the same hull. When the data from the tests of the 1/6- and 1/12-full-size models were compared on the basis of Froude's law of comparison, differences were found. This fact supported the belief that the small scale of the model and the use of a model that was too small to suit the equipment of the NACA tank had caused the results of the tests of the 1/12-full-size model to be less reliable than the results of the tests of the 1/6-full-size model. The results of the tests of the two models agreed sufficiently well to show that test of a small model, if made meticulously and with suitable equipment, may give useable results, but that a larger model should be used whenever feasible. The results of the NACA tests of the 1/6-full-size model were found to be in good agreement with the R.A.E. tests of a model of the same size.

description1403=Wie definieren wir Kundendienst, damit wir wissen können, was es ist und was es dauern wird, um es auf einem Niveau bieten, die konsequent als auch finanzierbar sein wird? Dies mag wie eine schwierige Frage für jeden zu Fragen, vor allem, wenn man nicht die Erfolgsbilanz vorzuweisen. Aber Norvell und Mitarbeiter verfügt über die Erfahrung und Glaubwürdigkeit einige Tipps zur Verbesserung eines Unternehmens. Hier sind die Tipps, wie Sie die erforderlichen Mitarbeiterfähigkeiten für exzellenten Kundenservice zu entwickeln\: 1. gut, wenn nicht einwandfreie, Kommunikationsfähigkeit Kundendienst kommuniziert vor allem mit Kunden, ob verbal oder nicht. Ein Lächeln ist oft der beste erste Ausdruck setzen Sie an Ihre Kunden vor den Worten 100 oder so heraus, was Sie sagen. Umgekehrt ist ein Stirnrunzeln das Mörder-Wort für jede Transaktion mit Menschen. Ihre Kunden sich wohl gestellt, versichern Ihnen dann sie haben Sie ihr Interesse daran mit wenigen Worten, wie "Wie kann ich Sie, Madam/Sir helfen?" Oder gehen direkt auf den Punkt und Fragen zu klären und Definieren von Bedingungen und Richtlinien, die sie nicht vollständig verstehen können. Das Lächeln lässt natürlich nie das Gesicht; Es ist eine ständige Qualitätssicherung, dass was der Kunde hört und sieht echt und bedeutete, ihre Zweifel und Ängste zu zerstreuen. Ohne diese wichtige Fähigkeit, eine Menge Probleme bleiben ungelöst und zu mehr Problemen führen. 2. zuhören können Menschen können mit Ohren geboren worden zu sein; aber das garantiert nicht, dass sie wissen, wie man zuhört. Oder wenn sie wissen, wie, sie haben nicht wirklich die Fähigkeiten, um alles zu verarbeiten, sie nach der anderen Person Sicht hören. Daher gibt es wirksame hören hat zwei Aspekte\: die Worte und der Sinn der Worte. Wir alle kennen die Bedeutungen der Wörter, im Allgemeinen. Für technisches Vokabular benötigen wir ein Wörterbuch oder einen Verweis definieren, worüber wir sprechen. Vergangenheit gegangen, haben wir gehen so weit zu verstehen, wie die andere Person ein bestimmtes Wort verwendet wird. Oft hilft haben ein Notebook oder ein Tablet, wesentliche Punkte während des Gesprächs aufzuschreiben Fragen im Kopf und im Kopf des Kunden zu klären. Wenn Grafiken, Zeichnungen oder Flussdiagramme erforderlich sind, werden Hinweise und visuelle Hilfsmittel um Probleme zu beheben nützlich sein. Es ist einfacher zu hören, wenn Sie Wörter mit Illustrationen Partnerschaft sind, um Verwirrung oder Missverständnisse zu vermeiden. Aber auch die buntesten Fotos oder Grafiken möglicherweise nicht genug, um den Punkt ankommt – sprechen Sie über die im Zusammenhang mit der Eigenschaft Grenzlinien. Es möglicherweise erforderlich, bei Menschen mit das Know-how oder die Behörde entscheiden, bestimmte Probleme zu bringen. Im Allgemeinen erfordert Umgang mit Kunden nicht allerdings eine richterliche oder mieten einen Anwalt um zu begleichen. Das Hauptziel ist es, zu Gunsten des Kunden, so weit wie möglich zu lösen. Der Schlüssel ist dann mit dem Kunden Interesse immer als der wichtigste Aspekt zu hören. 3. Produkt-Knowhow Ob Sie Bücher, Smartphones oder Pizza verkaufen, ist Produktwissen eine wesentliche Voraussetzung bei der Bereitstellung von Kundenzufriedenheit. Zu wissen, wie ein Produkt funktioniert--zum Beispiel wird eine neue Telefonfunktion, die Telekonferenzen – ermöglicht, zu einem Produkte Reiz und die Verkäuflichkeit hinzugefügt. Mehr noch, muss wenn ein Problem mit der Produktfunktion entsteht oder der Crustiness eine Pizza für Stammkunden inkonsistent ist, Angestellter wissen, die Lösungen für das Problem. Sofortiges Feedback zu geben, der Gesellschaft oder an andere Mitarbeiter ist ein Hauptmechanismus für jede Organisation. Produktkenntnisse muss Hand in Hand gehen mit Verfahrens- oder Management-Fähigkeiten im Umgang mit Kunden sorgen. 4. Ausdauer Umgang mit Kunden kann eine stressige und mühsame Aufgabe sein. In der Nähe der schließen-Stunden des Arbeitstages, können Kunden sein gereizt und auch ungeduldig mit Mitarbeitern, die ebenfalls müde und launisch. Es ist bei solchen Begegnungen Crunch-Time, dass Kommunikation oft bricht und Transaktionen fehlschlagen. Die alten 20 % Trefferquote von kalt-Akquisition Verkaufsgespräche können weiterhin auch in andere Formen der Kundenbetreuung Situationen angewendet. Aber das ist nur der Fall, wo der Mitarbeiter die Ausdauer hat, um alle notwendigen Werkzeuge und Fähigkeiten, um einen Verkauf zu schließen oder auf vollständige und exzellenten Service gleichermaßen für alle Kunden gelten. Es ist wie das einfache Prinzip Konfuzius lehrte seinen Jüngern über seinen ersten Job als junger Mann, das war einfach und leicht durchführbar\: alles er tun musste, war, das Gewicht oder das Volumen zu messen oder Reis richtig und an den Käufer übergeben. Solange er es richtig jedes Mal gemacht haben, hat er erfüllt, was von ihm verlangt wurde. In den meisten Fällen Angestellter tun muss, ist seine Arbeit anwenden, sorgfältig und so vollständig wie er oder sie sollte und, dass genügend Kundenservice vorsehen. Das erfordert Ausdauer. Aber wenn Probleme auftreten, das ist, wo die zusätzliche Kenntnisse und die außergewöhnliche Geduld an die Front gerufen werden. 5. Being Positive at all Times Life is full of drudgery and struggle that cause even the most upbeat of individuals to groan or complain. But in front of customers, emotional honesty cannot be a helpful tool, but rather, a deterrent to good customer-firm relations. Employees can learn the trick of remaining positive first and foremost through the use of positive language. Instead of using negative words ("we cannot repair your unit...." Or "you cannot get a replacement...."), they can turn the statement around to make them positive ("we will have your unit replaced or fixed if or when...."). Yes, it takes a happy person to make another person happy. Comedies make good use of the situation where the unhappy or disgruntled person pretends to be buoyant or unaffected. But rarely will it come out as funny when you are unhappy and you deal with customers who might also be unhappy. Unlike in math, two negatives will only multiply into more negativity. A positive employee has a greater chance of providing satisfaction to a complaining customer than a negative employee. The sun remains bright and hot even behind the clouds. And so, even if people's faces look cloudy, a positive attitude will remain as powerful as the invincible sunshine. Norvell and Associates believes in providing excellent customer service. And they have proven that these few tips are the best tools for any organization in convincing their customers to continue doing business with the company.

description1399=This article is from Cardiovascular Diabetology , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: Non-invasive measurements of 24 hour ambulatory central aortic systolic pressure (24 h-CASP) and central pulse pressure (24 h-CPP) are now feasible. We evaluate the relationship between 24 h central blood pressure and diabetes-related complications in patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods\: The study was cross-sectional, including 715 subjects\: 86 controls (C), 69 patients with short diabetes duration ( < 10 years), normoalbuminuria ( < 30 mg/24 h) without receiving antihypertensive treatment (SN), 211 with longstanding diabetes (≥ 10 years) and normoalbuminuria (LN), 163 with microalbuminuria (30-299 mg/24 h) (Mi) and 186 with macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/24 h) (Ma).24 h-CASP and 24 h-CPP was measured using a tonometric wrist-watch-like device (BPro, HealthStats, Singapore) and derived using N-point moving average. Results\: In C, SN, LN, Mi and Ma mean ± SD 24 h-CASP was\: 114 ± 17, 115 ± 13, 121 ± 13, 119 ± 16 and 121 ± 13 mmHg (p < 0.001); and 24 h-CPP\: 38 ± 8, 38 ± 7, 44 ± 10, 46 ± 11 and 46 ± 11 mmHg, (p < 0.001).Following rigorous adjustment (24 h mean arterial pressure and conventional risk factors), 24 h-CASP and 24 h-CPP increased with diabetes, albuminuria degree, previous cardiovascular disease (CVD), retinopathy and autonomic dysfunction (p ≤ 0.031).Odds ratios per 1 standard deviation increase in 24 h-CASP, 24 h-CPP and 24 h systolic blood pressure (24 h-SBP) were for CVD\: 3.19 (1.68-6.05), 1.43 (1.01-2.02) and 2.39 (1.32-4.33), retinopathy\: 4.41 (2.03-9.57), 1.77 (1.17-2.68) and 3.72 (1.85-7.47) and autonomic dysfunction\: 3.25 (1.65-6.41), 1.64 (1.12-2.39) and 2.89 (1.54-5.42). Conclusions\: 24 h-CASP and 24 h-CPP was higher in patients vs. controls and increased with diabetic complications independently of covariates. Furthermore, 24 h-CASP was stronger associated to complications than 24 h-SBP.The prognostic significance of 24 h-CASP and 24 h-CPP needs to be determined in follow-up studies.

description1398=This article is from BMC Infectious Diseases , volume 14 . Abstract Background\: The rate of decline of antibody titers to influenza following infection can affect results of serological surveys, and may explain re-infection and recurrent epidemics by the same strain. Methods\: We followed up a cohort who seroconverted on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (≥4-fold increase) to pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during a seroincidence study in 2009. Along with the pre-epidemic sample, and the sample from 2009 with the highest HI titer between August and October 2009 (A), two additional blood samples obtained in April 2010 and September 2010 (B and C) were assayed for antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm09 by both HI and virus microneutralization (MN) assays. We analyzed pair-wise mean-fold change in titers and the proportion with HI titers ≥ 40 and MN ≥ 160 (which correlated with a HI titer of 40 in our assays) at the 3 time-points following seroconversion. Results\: A total of 67 participants contributed 3 samples each. From the highest HI titer in 2009 to the last sample in 2010, 2 participants showed increase in titers (by HI and MN), while 63 (94%) and 49 (73%) had reduction in HI and MN titers, respectively. Titers by both assays decreased significantly; while 70.8% and 72.3% of subjects had titers of ≥ 40 and ≥ 160 by HI and MN in 2009, these percentages decreased to 13.9% and 36.9% by September 2010. In 6 participants aged 55 years and older, the decrease was significantly greater than in those aged below 55, so that none of the elderly had HI titers ≥ 40 nor MN titers ≥ 160 by the final sample. Due to this decline in titers, only 23 (35%) of the 65 participants who seroconverted on HI in sample A were found to seroconvert between the pre-epidemic sample and sample C, compared to 53 (90%) of the 59 who seroconverted on MN on Sample A. Conclusions\: We observed marked reduction in titers 1 year after seroconversion by HI, and to a lesser extent by MN. Our findings have implications for re-infections, recurrent epidemics, vaccination strategies, and for cohort studies measuring infection rates by seroconversion.

description1397=This article is from Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology \: RB&E , volume 12 . Abstract Background\: The Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) is a protandrous hermaphrodite that typically matures as a male at approximately 2–4 years of age and then changes sex in subsequent years. Although several sexual maturation stages have been described histologically for both testis and ovary, the underlying gene expression profiles remain lacking. The development of a gene expression platform is therefore necessary to improve our understanding of the gonad development of this cultured teleost species. Methods\: Thirty Asian seabass gonads were collected from farms in Singapore, examined histologically and staged according to their sex and gonadal maturation status. Partial coding sequences of 24 sex-related genes were cloned using degenerate primers and were sequenced. Additional 13 cDNA sequences were obtained through next-generation sequencing. A real-time qPCR was then performed using the microfluidic-based Fluidigm 48.48 Dynamic arrays. Results\: We obtained 17 ovaries and 13 testes at various stages of sexual maturation. Of the 37 genes that were tested, 32 (86%) showed sexually dimorphic expression. These genes included sex-related genes, sox9, wt1, amh, nr5a2, dmrt1 and nr0b1, which showed testis-enhanced expression similar to other vertebrate species. Known male- and female-enhanced germ cells markers, which were established from studies in other species, similarly showed testis- and ovary-enhanced expression, respectively, in the Asian seabass. Three pro-Wnt signaling genes were also upregulated in the ovary, consistent with existing studies that suggested the role of Wnt signaling in ovarian differentiation in teleosts and mammals. The expression patterns of genes involved in steroidogenesis, retinoic acid metabolism, apoptosis and NF-κB signaling were also described. We were able to classify gonads according to sex and gonadal maturation stages, based on their small-scale transcriptomic profiles, and to uncover a wide variation in expression profiles among individuals of the same sex. Conclusions\: The analysis of a selected set of genes related to reproduction and in sufficient number of individuals using a qPCR array can elucidate new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in Asian seabass gonad development. Given the conservation of gene expression patterns found in this study, these insights may also help us draw parallels with other teleosts.

description1395=This paper focuses on designing a comprehensibility test and a questionnaire for spoken world Englishes in Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore, and utilizing the test to investigate the comprehension of Burmese, Cambodians, Indonesians, Laotians, Thais and Vietnamese. We reviewed the demarcation of users of English based on Kachru's (1984, 1985) three concentric models within the bloc's context where two circles--Outer Circle and Expanding Circle are present. The findings established a moderate comprehensibility level of Expanding Circle listeners toward the speakers of the Outer Circle. The variations of comprehensibility scores paved way for the exploration of the comprehension scores' possible relationships with language proficiencies, attitudes toward speakers, familiarity of spoken variety, historical origins of languages, and political ambiance between and among ASEAN nations.

description1384=This article is from Safety and Health at Work , volume 3 . Abstract Singapore, an island republic of over 5 million inhabitants, has 3.1 million workers. Most are employed in the service, finance and tourist/transport industry. Significant numbers work in manufacturing, construction and heavy industry. Following a series of construction and shipyard accidents with multiple deaths in 2004, the government announced its intention to reduce workplace fatalities from 4.9 to 2.5 per 100,000 by 2015. There was strong political will to achieve this target. The strategic approaches were to build workplace safety and health (WSH) capabilities; implement legislative changes with enforcement; promote benefits of WSH and recognize best practices, and enhance partnership with stakeholders. The anticipated outcomes were to reduce workplace fatality and injury rates; have WSH as an integral part of business; and establish a progressive and pervasive WSH culture. With these measures, the workplace fatality rate declined from 4.9/100,000 in 2004, to 2.2/100,000 in 2010. However, other confounding factors could also account for this decline, and have to be considered. The next target, announced by Singapore's Prime Minister in 2008, is to further reduce the workplace fatality rate to 1.8/100,000 by 2018, and to have "one of the best workplace safety records in the world".

Stressing the role central state planning might take part in the development of the sector; he said India was well positioned to take greater advantage from the benefits of tourism. The minister was talking at a conference of tourism ministers in Delhi. One more aspect of the decline is the scam that targets tourists. He also requested the states to decrease taxes on tourism and aviation fuel so that more benefits could be expanded from this section for the country. Tourism minister Shripad Naik said that from next year the conference would be held for two days to enable greater interaction and participation of the states and other stakeholders. He added that the newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi was giving much focus on tourism, which is part of the five thrust areas. As portion of the plan, skill development and promotion of circuits will be provided consideration, and niche products and maintainable tourism standards will also be developed. E-Visa Whereas in other Indian tourism news, the government has exposed plans to begin offering electronic visas for foreign tourists by October. “The e-visa scheme is expected to be rolled out shortly. “We are trying to make it operational by October,” tourism minister Sripad Naik said after a national conference of state tourism ministers. In order to endorse cleanliness at tourist sites, the ministry will recompense states. A fresh classification will be instituted from 2016 in its yearly National Tourism Awards to identify the best efforts made by all states making sure cleanliness at their prominent places of tourist implication. The states will be compensated on the basis of a Cleanliness Index being evolved by the Ministry. The Index will rank the cities on the centering in cleanliness at ten popular destinations, one market place and three entry-exit points for each city. Then the three cleanest destinations and three cleanest cities will be awarded.

description1375=The occurrence of several Amphidromus species from Singapore is often mentioned in the literature (e.g., Laidlaw & Solem, 1961; Ho, 1995; Maassen, 2001). However there is scarcely mention of other genera in the family Camaenidae. At present, two camaenid genera have been recorded from Singapore, namely Amphidromus and Trachia (see Chan, 1996; Tan & Woo, 2010). This article documents a recent sighting of a living Trachia pudica (Godwin-Austen, 1891) in Singapore. Although not a new record, this observation is nonetheless noteworthy as it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first sighting of the living animal in Singapore. Prior to this observation, Trachia pudica has only been encountered as empty, or weathered and broken shells. Thus this report also serves as a confirmation of the presence of this species in Singapore.

description1373=For those who are not too observant about things, chalk dust and flour seemed to be the same. With proper tools, counterfeiting experts can change the components of a legitimate medicine to chalk starch or paint particles with ease, sell it to a gray market or fairly distribute it on different pharmacies with loose security and inventory system. Advancement in technology doesn’t make it too hard to label and brand the fake medicines after the real ones. This global drug trade is thriving in Africa.  The markets in Africa are filled with counterfeited medicines. These medicines are placed side by side with counterfeited medicines. If you pick the wrong box, it can eventually lead to your death.    The outbreak of Malaria in this continent has been advantageous for counterfeiters to introduce their products to the market. When it was finally found out that the increase of mortality rate has been caused by some unknown substance in the medicines that were given to patients, dispensed by public hospitals, fake medicines have already spread far and wide in the region.  The discovery, last June, 2013 led to one of the largest seizures of phony medicines ever. The fakes which are enough to treat more than half the country's annual malaria cases, had they been genuine according to Wall Street Journal are part of a proliferation of bogus malaria drugs in Africa that threatens to undermine years of progress in tackling the disease.  According to reports released by The Peterson Group , a non-profit organization campaigning against the proliferation of counterfeit medicines, about 100, 000 deaths in Africa are linked to fraud drug products . The British think-tank, International Policy Network, on the other hand, estimates that globally, 700,000 deaths a year are caused by fake malaria and tuberculosis drug comparing the death toll to the equivalent of “four fully laden jumbo jets crashing every day.”  Many analysts blame the importers from Asia for the havoc it brought in Africa. China is known to have the practice of counterfeiting and many believe the distributors also come from the country. It is, in fact, not a secret that China, along with India, has a lot of records and complaints on the production of many counterfeit products. PRC also have the largest production base for both active and unfinished drugs around the world.  However, many cities are already being dragged in the fray. Jakarta, Indonesia and Hanoi, Vietnam to name a few are also included as they are also suspected to distribute their locally-produced fraud medicines.
description1372=This study examined the effect of an English intervention program on Singaporan pupils' proficiency in listening and spoken language skills in English and their native language. In 1966, the Singapore Ministry of Education instituted a bilingual school program to ensure that children developed a command of English and one native language. In 1983, the Institute of Education began a longitudinal study consisting of three phases. In the first phase, kindergarten children were tested for language, mathematics, general cognitive skills, and social behavior. In the second phase, teachers at nonprivate kindergartens received special training in language teaching. Teachers in one group were trained by institute staff; those in another group by supervisors at their local schools. Parent involvement in education is currently being studied in the third phase. The effectiveness of the teacher training intervention was assessed by means of a test of the language skills of children taught by the two groups of trained teachers studied in the second phase. Results indicated that these students made gains in language skills. Both groups of students made significant gains over a control group of children whose teachers had not received training. Gains made in knowledge of English words were exceptionally encouraging. However, the native language skills of children in the group whose teachers were trained by institute staff were adversely affected by the intervention. A reference list of 15 items is provided.

description1363=It would have been better if World Health Organization has cautioned the blind and the deaf, they may have listened more but the ignorance of people to precautions and warnings has led to high mortality rate and worsening disease symptoms. Using different media and even fellow non-profit organizations, WHO has rounded up most information both in developing and already developed countries. From the busy streets of New York to the heavy traffic in Jakarta, Indonesia, the information has been passed on. The organization also took advantage of the partnership with other institutions. The Peterson Group , an online non-profit society is one of the institutions avidly campaigning against the proliferation of counterfeit medicines in South East Asia. Along with numerous local groups campaigning for the same cause, a lot of developing Asian nations are already informed. Yet, there may be possible reasons for people to become unaware. The variety of information makes compiling data a difficult task. Sources of information include historic data which can sometimes already be obsolete. This is one of the reasons why there is not much trust in the information given by WHO and the main details are oftentimes overlooked. Another factor hindering information from being spread are the political powers moving behind their names and standing in society. Those who have the authority to inform may not have fully discussed the severity of the situation and may have not emphasized the impact of counterfeit medicines to one’s health. It may also be that the authority itself is behind fraudulent transactions , gaining profits from mafia groups and scammers. Strengthening medicine regulatory authorities (MRAs), improving quality of production, and facilitating the availability of relatively inexpensive, good-quality anti-infective are likely to be key factors in the effectiveness of the information being responded to. There is an urgent need for data of sufficient sample size with random sampling design to reliably estimate the prevalence of counterfeited medicines. Such data are vital to select appropriate interventions, assess their effectiveness, and follow changes through time. Recent literature has concentrated on poor-quality anti-malarials, but it is likely that other anti-infective medicines are also profoundly affected. We do not know how counterfeit and substandard medicines compare with respect to their impact. We also have little information on what proportion of patients or health workers are aware of the issues in different societies, and which interventions may be the most effective. Without the help of different sectors, these planned interventions may not come to realization.

description1357=This study examined the role of faculty participation on strategic change within higher education. An open-ended questionnaire was completed by seven individuals from Singapore and the United States who had had experience with higher education strategic planning and change as both faculty and administrators in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and the United States. It was found that all of the respondents agreed on the necessity of involving stakeholders, particularly the faculty, in strategic change. Many also pointed to the difficulty of getting quality participation from faculty, due to the fact that faculty often have a narrow perspective, that faculty participation involves a large commitment of time, and that faculty are often reluctant to address complex issues or problems. Respondents emphasized the negative impact of overly hierarchical and bureaucratic organizational structures, which were more typical in Singapore than elsewhere. The comments also emphasized the impact that organizational culture, planning processes, reward structures, and institutional mission can have on faculty participation in strategic change. Suggestions for encouraging and improving faculty participation were also offered. (Contains 32 references.) (MDM)

description1354=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: The manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene, which encodes a chief reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzyme, has been reported to be associated with the risk of developing sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) in some Asian races and the synapsin III (SYN3) gene with some neuropsychiatric diseases. Objective\: To explore the associations between the MnSOD and SYN III variations and PD in two Chinese populations from mainland China and Singapore. Methods\: We recruited 2342 subjects including 1200 sporadic PD patients and 1142 healthy controls from two independent Asian countries. Using a case-control methodology, we genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in MnSOD (rs4880) and SYN III (rs3788470, rs3827336, rs5998557) to explore the associations with risk of PD. Results\: The results showed the genotype distributions and minor allele frequencies (MAF) of MnSOD (rs4880) and SYN III (rs3788470, rs3827336, rs5998557) were not significantly different between PD patients and healthy controls in mainland China and Singapore, as well as in merged populations. Conclusions\: The variations of MnSOD (rs4880) and SYN III (rs3788470, rs3827336, rs5998557) were not major risk factors for PD among Chinese, at least in our study populations.
description1353=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: Diabetes is reported to be linked to poorer cognitive function. The purpose of this study is to examine (a) clinical correlation between cognitive function and the biochemical perturbations in T2DM, and (b) the impact of statin treatment on cognitive function in diabetic subjects. Methods\: Forty Singaporean Chinese males with diabetes and twenty Singaporean Chinese males without diabetes were recruited for this study. Twenty-two of the diabetic subjects were on statin therapy and all subjects were non-demented. This was a 2-period non-interventional case-control study in which subjects were assessed for cognitive function in period 1 and blood samples taken over 2 periods, approximately 1 week apart. Blood was collected to determine the level of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, glucose and insulin. Cognitive performance was measured by a neuropsychological battery covering domains of attention, language, verbal and visual memory, visuomotor speed and executive function. Z-scores were derived for each cognitive domain using the mean and standard deviations (SDs), and they were used to compare between (a) diabetic and non-diabetic groups, and (b) diabetic subjects with and without statin treatment. ANCOVAs with age, education, BMI, and the duration of diabetes as covariates were employed to examine differences in mean score of cognitive domains and subtests between the two groups. Results\: Overall cognitive function was similar among diabetics and age matched non-diabetic controls. Among diabetic statin users, HDL, LDL and total cholesterol were negatively correlated with executive function, whereas peripheral insulin levels and insulin resistance were negatively associated with attention. Conclusion\: Diabetic statin users were likely to have poorer performance in attention and executive function. Increasing levels of the peripheral biomarkers are likely to contribute to poorer cognitive performance.

A risk assessment model incorporating both validated genetic variants and established risk factors may improve its performance in risk prediction of Asian women. Methods\: A nested case-control study of female breast cancer (411 cases and 1,212 controls) within the Singapore Chinese Health Study was conducted to investigate the effects of 51 genetic variants identified in previous GWAS on breast cancer risk. The independent effect of these genetic variants was assessed by creating a summed genetic risk score (GRS) after adjustment for body mass index and the Gail model risk factors for breast cancer. Results\: The GRS was an independent predictor of breast cancer risk in Chinese women. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of breast cancer for the second, third, and fourth quartiles of the GRS were 1.26 (0.90 to 1.76), 1.47 (1.06 to 2.04) and 1.75 (1.27 to 2.41) respectively (P for trend
description1351=This article is from PLoS Genetics , volume 10 . Abstract South Asia possesses a significant amount of genetic diversity due to considerable intergroup differences in culture and language. There have been numerous reports on the genetic structure of Asian Indians, although these have mostly relied on genotyping microarrays or targeted sequencing of the mitochondria and Y chromosomes. Asian Indians in Singapore are primarily descendants of immigrants from Dravidian-language–speaking states in south India, and 38 individuals from the general population underwent deep whole-genome sequencing with a target coverage of 30X as part of the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP). The genetic structure and diversity of these samples were compared against samples from the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project and populations in Phase 1 of the 1,000 Genomes Project (1 KGP). SSIP samples exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and possessed higher heterozygous-to-homozygous genotype ratio than other Asian populations. When compared against a panel of well-defined Asian Indians, the genetic makeup of the SSIP samples was closely related to South Indians. However, even though the SSIP samples clustered distinctly from the Europeans in the global population structure analysis with autosomal SNPs, eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups that were predominantly present in Europeans and possessed higher European admixture than the remaining samples. An analysis of the relative relatedness between SSIP with two archaic hominins (Denisovan, Neanderthal) identified higher ancient admixture in East Asian populations than in SSIP. The data resource for these samples is publicly available and is expected to serve as a valuable complement to the South Asian samples in Phase 3 of 1 KGP.

description1348=This article is from Frontiers in Neurology , volume 5 . Abstract Human sleep schedules vary widely across countries. We investigated whether these variations were related to differences in social factors, Morningness–Eveningness (ME) preference, or the natural light–dark cycle by contrasting the sleep duration and timing of young adults (age\: 18–35 years) on work and free days in Singapore (n \= 1898) and the UK (n \= 837). On work days, people in Singapore had later bedtimes, but wake times were similar to the UK sample, resulting in shorter sleep duration. In contrast, sleep duration on free days did not differ between the two countries. Shorter sleep on work days, without compensatory extra long sleep hours on free days, suggest greater demands from work and study in Singapore. While the two samples differed slightly in ME preference, the associations between eveningness preference and greater extension in sleep duration as well as delays in sleep timing on free days were similar in the two countries. Thus, differences in ME preference did not account for the differences in sleep schedules between the two countries. The greater variability in the photoperiod in the UK was not associated with more prominent seasonal changes in sleep patterns compared to Singapore. Furthermore, in the UK, daylight saving time did not alter sleep schedules relative to clock time. Collectively, these findings suggest that differences in social demands, primarily from work or study, could account for the observed differences in sleep schedules between countries, and that in industrialized societies, social zeitgebers, which typically involve exposure to artificial light, are major determinants of sleep schedules.

description1346=Talent acquisition is the process of finding and acquiring skilled human labor for organizational needs and to meet any labor requirement. When used in the context of the recruiting and HR profession, talent acquisition usually refers to the talent acquisition department or team within the Human Resources department. WE Consulting talent acquisition team is responsible for finding, acquiring, assessing, and hiring candidates to fill roles that are required to meet goals and fill project requirements for your corporation. In recent years, the recruitment process and recruiting teams have undergone a makeover of sorts. New terms, such as “talent acquisition” or “human capital management” have emerged as a different way of talking about the recruiting process. Talent acquisition as a function has become closely aligned with marketing and PR as well as Human Resources. As global organisations need to recruit globally with disparate needs and requirements, effective recruiting requires a well thought out corporate messaging around hiring and talent development. WE Consulting talent acquisition professionals often craft the unique company message around the approach the company takes to hiring and the ongoing development of employees. The employment brand therefore encompasses not only the procurement of human capital, but the approach to corporate employee development. The unique needs of large companies especially to recruit and hire as well as attract top talent led to the development of a unique talent acquisition practice and career. Our recruitment role is responsible for sourcing talent and bringing qualified candidates to your organisation. However, modern talent acquisition is becoming a unique skill-set. Because talent acquisition professionals many times also handle post-hire talent issues, such as employee retention and career progression, WE Consulting talent acquisition role is a distinct craft; we are intertwined with your organisation’s ultimate success and effectiveness.
description1345=Edwin Sim, Human Capital Alliance managing director looks at the positive power of happiness. People perform significantly better when their brains experience positive emotions that create a “happiness advantage” Recently I had the pleasure of listening to a TED talk presented by Shawn Acor, an American corporate trainer, author and speaker known for his positive psychology advocacy. The Harvard trained Acor who authored “The Happiness Advantage and founded the Institute of Positive Research and Good Thinking said most companies and schools follow what he calls a scientifically broken and backward formula for success. Traditional success formula For many people a traditional success formula tracks the following success factors. “….if I work harder, I’ll be more successful. And if I’m more successful, then I’ll be happier. That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior.’ This methodology, Acor said was scientifically broken and backward because every time a person’s brain experiences success, they change the success goal posts. “You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better one, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we’re going to change it.” “What we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ, 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels, your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.” Happiness on opposite side of success If happiness is on the opposite side of success, Acor said a brain never gets there. “We’ve pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon, as a society. And that’s because we think we have to be successful, then we’ll be happier.” Our brains however work in the opposite order. “If you can raise somebody’s level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage\: your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed.” Happiness advantage Brains experiencing a happiness advantage inevitably perform with higher intelligence, creativity and energy levels, Acor said. His research also found that every single business outcome improves. “Your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed.” Salesmen were 37% more productive while doctors worked 19% faster and were more accurate with their diagnoses. Reversing traditional formula If we want our brains to work harder, faster and more intelligently, we must find ways to become positive in the present. The traditional formula must be reversed so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of. Dopamine, which floods into your system when we’re positive, he said has two functions. It not only makes us happier, but it also turns on all of brain’s learning centers to adapt to the world in a different way. Training your brain to be more positive In his work with many companies, Acor asked people to write down three new things they are grateful for, 21 days in a row. At the end of 21 days, their brains begin scanning the world for positive rather than negative things first. The exercise he said actually rewired people’s brains to work more optimistically and more successfully. Exercising your brain When people recall positive experiences they’ve experienced in the past 24 hours, it allows their brains to relive it. Meditation also allows brains to get over the cultural Attention Deficit Hyperactivy Disorder (ADHD) that is created by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand. Acor also has exercises that encourage people to open up their inboxes, to write one positive email praising or thanking someone in their support network. By undertaking these brain-training activities, we can reverse the formula for happiness and success, and in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity, but a real revolution.

description1337=This article is from PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases , volume 8 . Abstract Background\: Dengue causes 50 million infections per year, posing a large disease and economic burden in tropical and subtropical regions. Only a proportion of dengue cases require hospitalization, and predictive tools to triage dengue patients at greater risk of complications may optimize usage of limited healthcare resources. For severe dengue (SD), proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 dengue guidelines, predictive tools are lacking. Methods\: We undertook a retrospective study of adult dengue patients in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, from 2006 to 2008. Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables at presentation from dengue polymerase chain reaction-positive and serology-positive patients were used to predict the development of SD after hospitalization using generalized linear models (GLMs). Principal findings\: Predictive tools compatible with well-resourced and resource-limited settings – not requiring laboratory measurements – performed acceptably with optimism-corrected specificities of 29% and 27% respectively for 90% sensitivity. Higher risk of severe dengue (SD) was associated with female gender, lower than normal hematocrit level, abdominal distension, vomiting and fever on admission. Lower risk of SD was associated with more years of age (in a cohort with an interquartile range of 27–47 years of age), leucopenia and fever duration on admission. Among the warning signs proposed by WHO 2009, we found support for abdominal pain or tenderness and vomiting as predictors of combined forms of SD. Conclusions\: The application of these predictive tools in the clinical setting may reduce unnecessary admissions by 19% allowing the allocation of scarce public health resources to patients according to the severity of outcomes.
description1336=This article is from PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases , volume 8 . Abstract Background\: Dengue is an important viral infection with different presentations. Predicting disease severity is important in triaging patients requiring hospital care. We aim to study the value of proteinuria in predicting the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), utility of urine dipstick test as a rapid prognostic tool. Methodology and principal findings\: Adult patients with undifferentiated fever (n \= 293) were prospectively enrolled at the Infectious Disease Research Clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore from January to August 2012. Dengue infection was confirmed in 168 (57%) by dengue RT-PCR or NS1 antigen detection. Dengue cases had median fever duration of 6 days at enrolment. DHF was diagnosed in 34 cases according to the WHO 1997 guideline. Dengue fever (DF) patients were predominantly younger and were mostly seen in the outpatient setting with higher platelet level. Compared to DF, DHF cases had significantly higher peak urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) during clinical course (26 vs. 40 mg/mmol; p

description1333=The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) is an international comparative study of student achievement. In 2011, PIRLS was administered to nationally representative samples of 4th-grade students in 53 education systems around the world. The PIRLS assessment measures student performance on a combined reading literacy scale, as well as two subscales of purposes of reading\: reading for literary experience and reading to acquire and use information. This report compares the performance of U.S. students with their peers around the world and also examines how the reading literacy of U.S. 4th-grade students has changed since the first administration of PIRLS in 2001 and the previous administration in 2006. Results are presented by two student characteristics (sex and race/ethnicity) and by one measure of school poverty (percent of students in the school eligible for free or reduced-price lunch). In the United States, one state, Florida, participated as a separate education system and is included in international comparisons. Total counts of education systems include Florida, not only as part of the U.S. national sample of public and private schools, but also individually with the state level public school sample. Note that because all education systems participating in PIRLS are treated equally, Florida is compared with the United States (national sample) throughout this report. All differences described in this report are statistically significant at the 0.05 level. No statistical adjustments to account for multiple comparisons were used. Key findings for the reading literacy scale in 2011 include the following\: (1) The average score for U.S. students (556) was higher than the international PIRLS scale average, which is set to 500; (2) In 2011 the United States was among the top 13 education systems (5 education systems had higher averages and 7 were not measurably different). The United States average was higher than 40 education systems; (3) The 5 education systems with average scores above the U.S. average were Hong Kong-CHN, Florida-USA, the Russian Federation, Finland, and Singapore; (4) Compared with 2001, the U.S. average score was 14 points higher in 2011 (542 in 2001 vs. 556 in 2011); (5) Compared with 2006, the U.S. average score was 16 points higher in 2011 (540 in 2006 vs. 556 in 2011); (6) Considering the percentage of 4th-graders performing at or above the "Advanced" international reading benchmark\: two education systems had a percentage that was higher than the United States, 7 education systems had percentages that were not measurably different than the United States, and 43 education systems had percentages lower than the United States; (7) The average score for girls was higher than the average scores for boys in the United States (562 vs. 551) and in the one education system separately assessed in the United States, Florida (576 vs. 561); (8) Compared to the U.S. national average reading score\: White, Asian, and multiracial students scored higher on average, while Black and Hispanic 4th-graders scored lower on average than the U.S. average; and (9) In the United States, schools were classified into five categories on the basis of the percentage of students in the school eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. The percentage of students eligible and the average reading score in each category are as follows\: less than 10 percent (605), 10 to 24.9 percent (584), 25 to 49.9 percent (568), 50 to 74.9 percent (544), and 75 percent or more (520). In all cases, children from schools with a lower level of free lunch eligibility had a higher average score than children from schools with a higher level of free lunch eligibility. Appended are\: (1) Technical Notes; (2) Reading Passages and Items; (3) PIRLS-NAEP Comparison; and (4) Online Resources and Publications. (Contains 11 tables, 5 figures and 20 footnotes.)
description1332=Kirton (1976) described two creative styles, namely adaptors and innovators. Adaptors prefer to "do things better" whilst, innovators prefer to "do things differently". This study explored the relationship between two creative styles (adaptor and innovator) and the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience) and how they subscribe to creativity, risks and goal orientations. A total of 206 Polytechnic students from Singapore completed a self-report questionnaire, which consisted of the Kirton Adaptation-Innovation Inventory (Kirton, 1976), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (Saucier, 1994), Learning Goal Scale (Ng, 2003), What Kind of Person Are You Self-Report Inventory (Khatena & Torrance, 1976), Gough's Creative Adjective Checklist, Risk Scenario, and Risk Taking Attitude Scale developed by Ng. It was found that adaptors were significantly more conscientious and subscribe to risk avoidance, ego approach and ego avoidance orientations than innovators, whilst, innovators were significantly more extraverted and open to experience and are likely to subscribe to creativity, risk taking and mastery goal orientations than adaptors. No significant differences were found between adaptors and innovators in agreeableness. The implications for the findings for the classroom teacher will also be discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)

description1330=Rapid technological development in the last decade has made it easier than ever to use technologies as collaborative learning tools. Computer video conferencing as a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) technology brings learners closer to real-world environments and it provides increasing opportunities for learners to share experiences across time and space. This paper reports on how multipoint desktop video conferencing (MDVC) is used in preservice teacher education programs in Singapore. Summative research findings reveal that student teachers reacted positively to the scaffolding provided by peers and supervisors via video conferencing. MDVC apparently opened up a new avenue for collegial learning, and student teachers do not have to rely only on the expertise found in their own schools. (Contains 18 references.) (Author)

description1317=This article is from International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health , volume 10 . Abstract Physical inactivity is a significant contributor to worldwide mortality and morbidity associated with non-communicable diseases. An excellent avenue to incorporate lifestyle physical activity into regular routine is to encourage the use of stairs during daily commutes. We evaluated the effectiveness of point-of-decision prompts (PODPs) in promoting the use of stairs instead of the escalators in a Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station. We measured the number of stair climbers before the PODPs were put up, during the 4 weeks that they were in use, and 2 weeks after they were removed. Measurements at a no intervention control site were additionally taken. The use of stair-riser banners was associated with an increase in the number of people using the stairs by a factor of 1.49 (95% CI 1.34–1.64). After the banners were removed, the number of stair climbers at the experimental station dropped to slightly below baseline levels. The Singapore MRT serves a diverse multi-ethnic population with an average daily ridership of over 2 million and 88 stations island-wide. An increase of physical activity among these MRT commuters would have a large impact at the population level. Our findings can be translated into part of the national strategy to encourage an active lifestyle in Singaporeans.
description1316=This article is from Breast Cancer Research \: BCR , volume 14 . Abstract Introduction\: Increased mammographic breast density is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. While two-thirds of the variation in mammographic density appears to be genetically influenced, few variants have been identified. We examined the association of inherited variation in genes from pathways that mediate cell division with percent mammographic density (PMD) adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI) and postmenopausal hormones, in two studies of healthy postmenopausal women. Methods\: We investigated 2,058 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 378 genes involved in regulation of mitosis for associations with adjusted PMD among 484 unaffected postmenopausal controls (without breast cancer) from the Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Study (MCBCS) and replicated the findings in postmenopausal controls (n \= 726) from the Singapore and Sweden Breast Cancer Study (SASBAC) study. PMD was assessed in both studies by a computer-thresholding method (Cumulus) and linear regression approaches were used to assess the association of SNPs and PMD, adjusted for age, BMI and postmenopausal hormones. A P-value threshold of 4.2 × 10-5 based on a Bonferroni correction of effective number of independent tests was used for statistical significance. Further, a pathway-level analysis was conducted of all 378 genes using the self-contained gene-set analysis method GLOSSI. Results\: A variant in PRPF4, rs10733604, was significantly associated with adjusted PMD in the MCBCS (P \= 2.7 × 10-7), otherwise, no single SNP was associated with PMD. Additionally, the pathway analysis provided no evidence of enrichment in the number of associations observed between SNPs in the mitotic genes and PMD (P \= 0.60). We evaluated rs10733604 (PRPF4), and 73 other SNPs at P < 0.05 from 51 genes in the SASBAC study. There was no evidence of an association of rs10733604 (PRPF4) with adjusted PMD in SASBAC (P \= 0.23). There were, however, consistent associations (P < 0.05) of variants at the putative locus, LOC375190, Aurora B kinase (AURKB), and Mini-chromosome maintenance complex component 3 (MCM3) with adjusted PMD, although these were not statistically significant. Conclusions\: Our findings do not support a role of inherited variation in genes involved in regulation of cell division and adjusted percent mammographic density in postmenopausal women.
description1315=This article is from Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene , volume 108 . Abstract Background\: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of adult mortality in Asia. Appropriate empirical treatment depends on knowledge of the pathogens commonly responsible. However, assessing the aetiological significance of identified organisms is often difficult, particularly with sputum isolates that might represent contamination with oropharyngeal flora. Methods\: A systematic review of all adult CAP aetiology studies from Asia, excluding the Middle East, published in English between 1 January 1990 and 1 March 2012 was conducted. Forty-eight studies reporting on 10 423 patients were included, representing data from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Data from large parts of Asia were unavailable and there was substantial heterogeneity in methodology. Results\: As in western studies, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae were all significant pathogens. However, compared with western studies, S. pneumoniae was of less relative importance. Gram-negative bacilli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were more important, and in northeast Thailand Burkholderia pseudomallei was a major pathogen. Conclusion\: These data have major implications for diagnostic strategies and empirical treatment. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeting S. pneumoniae may be inappropriate in many Asian settings, and agents active against TB may lead to partial response and delayed TB diagnosis.

description1313=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic factors in type 2 diabetes (T2D), mostly among individuals of European ancestry. We tested whether previously identified T2D-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) replicate and whether SNPs in regions near known T2D SNPs were associated with T2D within the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Methods\: 2338 cases and 2339 T2D controls from the Singapore Chinese Health Study were genotyped for 507,509 SNPs. Imputation extended the genotyped SNPs to 7,514,461 with high estimated certainty (r2>0.8). Replication of known index SNP associations in T2D was attempted. Risk scores were computed as the sum of index risk alleles. SNPs in regions ±100 kb around each index were tested for associations with T2D in conditional fine-mapping analysis. Results\: Of 69 index SNPs, 20 were genotyped directly and genotypes at 35 others were well imputed. Among the 55 SNPs with data, disease associations were replicated (at p

description1309=This study investigated the impact of parents with different language backgrounds on the language acquisition and language competency of their children in the mother tongue, Chinese, and a second language, English, in Singapore. Parents were surveyed on language usage and language materials provided to their children. Exams on vocabulary, listening comprehension, story comprehension, translation, and verbal fluency were given to students in both English and Chinese in a preschool and a primary school that taught both languages. The findings showed that the respondent parents and students from both schools were at ease using the language in which they were most competent, and most parents in both schools purchased learning and reading materials in both English and Chinese. The language of the extra reading and learning materials bought or borrowed had hardly any impact on the scores of language tests. Only the language of the books read aloud to the children made a difference. As expected, children read to in Chinese scored better on the Chinese vocabulary and fluency tests; the converse was true for those read to in English. Results suggest that the extent of exposure to a language makes a difference to a child's competency in the language. (AP)

Underlying the increasing pressure for new models of TVET provision is the rapid pace of technological change, demand for a work force which is highly responsive to evolving needs and a transforming market place that calls for higher order skills and  lifelong learning. The book proposes a re-engineered, modernized TVET system that fosters an innovative approach which enhances the employability of workers as well as the sustainability of their livelihoods. The book includes contributions from leading policy makers, researchers, and practitioners, including those in the private sector in analyzing and forecasting the most urgent priorities in skills development.  The book argues for creative approaches to TVET design and delivery particularly with a view to improving job prospects , and meeting the goals of inclusion, sustainable development and social cohesion. Addressing issues such as the chronic mismatches between skills acquired and actual skills required in the work place, the volume proposes diversified approaches towards workforce development and partnerships with the private sector to improve the quality and relevance of skills development .   The new imperatives created by ‘greening’ economies and responses required in skills development and training are addressed. Developing TVET is a high priority for governments in the Asia Pacific region as they  seek to achieve long-term sustainable  growth since the .continued success of their economic destinies depend on it. The volume also includes an emerging framework for skills development for inclusive and sustainable growth in the Asia and Pacific region.\n

description1302=This article is a critique of the Dworkinian theory of fairness in the context of Affirmative Action. Although Dworkin committed tremendous endeavors in an attempt to give a fairness argument backed by an empirical study, the question of whether affirmative action is fair remains inconclusive. The sample used in the study is unrepresentative, and the results are open to interpretation. If legitimacy and fairness of a policy is a matter of the fit between the theory and the practical consequence, would the change of racial composition within the country, such as the increasing number of immigrants, and the change of a country's role in the international community, such as globalization, affect the current meaning of diversity? Moreover, although diversity seems to be a reasonable goal, Dworkin failed to make a strong case for why specially admitting Blacks into elite universities is essential for justice. Also, the question of fairness remains unanswered because the lesson of Singapore and Malaysia shows that the general interest of society is not warranted by a policy of sacrificing a few people.
description1301=The care and education of children is a primary task of all societies, and the role of parents, families, and communities is essential in this process. This directory describes the major activities of 360 non-governmental and governmental organizations, based in 30 countries in Asia and the Pacific region (Australia; Bangladesh; Bhutan; Cambodia; China; Fiji; Guam; Hong Kong; India; Indonesia; Iran; Israel; Japan; Kazakhstan; Korea; Malaysia; Maldives; Nepal; New Zealand; Pacific Islands; Pakistan; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Singapore; Solomon Islands; Sri Lanka; Thailand; Turkey; Vanuatu; Vietnam; and Western Samoa), involved in early childhood care and education. Pertinent data on these organizations' family, young child, and community programs and their information activities are included. The directory is intended for professionals working with and for children, to facilitate communication and information-sharing to improve the situation of children. Directory information was compiled through a questionnaire sent to 800 Asian-Pacific organizations. A sample questionnaire is included with the directory to encourage users to update the information provided. Two articles offer an overview of the situation of children and their family environment in Asia and the Pacific, and an analysis of the information collected in the directory. Statistical tables then present an overview of basic social and economic statistics by country, directly concerning the 0-5 year age group. Profiles are arranged alphabetically by country and official organization name, and include the following\: (1) identification and contact information; (2) aims, type, and countries in which the organization is active; (3) cooperation/partnership activities; (4) major activities in the young child, family, and community programs; and (5) services and information activities offered. Lists of potential funding sources of early childhood activities and information sources on early childhood issues are included. Five indices facilitate information retrieval. Included in the annexes are the main provisions of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. A form for evaluating the directory is included. (KDFB)

description1296=The history of technical and vocational education in Singapore goes back only to the mid-1960s, when it received attention in response to the policies of industrialization adopted when Singapore became an independent republic. Establishment of the Industrial Training Board (ITB) in 1973 was the first significant step toward formalizing vocational training outside the school system. The ITB merged with the Adult Education Board in 1979 to form the Vocational and Industrial Training Board, which was recently restructured and replaced by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). The main training programs of the ITE are full-time, preemployment institutional training for school leavers, part-time continuing education and training for workers, and apprenticeship and industry-based training. A system of establishing skills standards and curriculum development has been established to ensure that courses are relevant and meet industry requirements. To evaluate program performance, ITE conducts surveys of employers, course evaluation, and employment experiences on a regular basis. A Feature Analysis Model is used to assess effectiveness of individual courses. New plans and strategies to upgrade the vocational and technical training system have been recommended and there will be renewed emphasis on apprenticeship and intensified efforts to promote continuing education and training. (Appendixes include organizational charts, course lists, data charts, and 10 references.) (YLB)

description1295=Background\: In 2005, the North Zone Clusters of Schools made action research their niche development project with the aim of equipping the teachers with conceptual understanding and skills in conducting action research. Training workshops were mounted in seven centres. This is the first time action research is promoted en mass among Singapore as a form of professional up-grading. After the workshops, teachers were encouraged to conduct their own action research projects. More than 70 such projects were selected for presentation at the North Zone Action Research Symposium held in November 2005. The proceedings were published as Celebrating Learning through Action Research. Aims or focus of discussion\: This paper aims to describe the process of conducting the workshops, including the approach chosen, the examples used, and the principles of measuring the outcomes, and the techniques of data analysis. The paper highlights the common administrative concerns and the conceptual and methodological needs of teachers in the context of action research (as contrasted with academic research). Arguments/comments/suggestions\: The writer believes that such a concerted effort in promoting action research is worthy of documentation. The information of the experiences and the problems encountered are useful to alert other action research trainers in planning and preparing. Conclusion\: Teachers need to be equipped with the conceptual understanding and methodological skills in conducting action research. There are some "blind spots" needing attention.

description1294=Drug Counterfeiting is one of the most underrated crimes in the world. It is seldom being focused in the media. If it is, it takes only the 1-minute news segment or an inner paged column in the newspaper. Moreover, this illegal practice is common in countries considered poor. Because of this, it does not entirely attract global attention. Drug counterfeiting is a crucial issue as it is the cause of unnecessary morbidity, mortality and loss of public confidence in medicines and health structures. In its present situation, however, only non-profit organizations’ names are being dragged and involved in most of its cases. World Health Organization (WHO) has been actively participating in its chase, so is Impact, the Peterson Group and other NGOs which even get little recognition from the public. The prevalence of counterfeit drugs seems to be rising as stated in dozens of reviews and studies. The most likely target are countries with loose security measures but cities such as Jakarta, Indonesia , Beijing, China and even Singapore are involved even when there are strict impositions of regulations and heavy penalties within their boundaries. According to a study conducted by Plos Journal, “…It has been estimated that up to 15% of all sold drugs are fake, and in parts of Africa and Asia this figure exceeds 50%”. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on the other hand, estimates that 10% of global medicine market is fraud. Hence, this estimate suggests that criminal sales on drug counterfeiting amount to $35,000,000,000 per year. The number has been predicted to double within the last five years, albeit the total scope of the problem cannot be fully determined. Demographics and difference of culture hinder researchers to fully identify the scale of the issue. Also, most recent studies suggest that many pharmaceutical companies and governments have been reluctant to publicize the problem to health staff and the public, apparently motivated by the belief that the “publicity will harm the sales of brand-name products in a fiercely competitive business”. Publicly, at least, several industry sources say the justification for secrecy is to avoid any alarm that could prevent patients taking their genuine medicines. Yet, NGOs see the dangers on the lack of warnings. It can harm patients and only protects pharmaceutical companies. In the side of the government, there is a dilemma on which to prioritize between health and economic industry. While some drug companies have given public warnings to protect patients, others have been criticized for withholding information. Even courts fail to act. When will they ever be transparent?

description1292=Public relations educators delivering courses to international students find that each cohort of students interprets and understands public relations theory and its application to practice according to their respective cultures. The premise of this paper is to reflect on some of the interpretations and expectations of public relations students enrolled in postgraduate master classes from 2003 to 2007 in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, at the University of South Australia. The Australian masters' classes include cohorts of international students from diverse cultures. This paper suggests that public relations educators need to adapt their style of delivery and methods of assessment to facilitate optimum engagement of diverse groups of students taking account their varied political, religious and social backgrounds that shape their thinking and perception of public relations theory and practice.

description1285=In this study, data were collected on 15 visitor groups for the duration of their stay, and on 1556 visitor groups at 18 exhibits at the Singapore Zoo. Mean time at the zoo was 155 minutes; the distribution of the time spent among four activities was analyzed by ethnicity and group size. The actual route followed was traced on zoo maps and group location noted every 10 minutes, leading to a prediction of the route followed by a typical visitor. The mean time viewing an exhibit was 62.8 seconds but varied considerably among exhibits. Data were also analyzed by time of day, ethnicity, group size, species observed, and activity level of the animals. Visitor behavior patterns were also analyzed based on label length and difficulty, and popularity of the species. Taken together, the data provide a general understanding of how recreational visitors behave in zoos with respect to several variables of interest to zoo professionals. (Author/CW)

description1283=This article describes a school-wide arts education project that incorporates an interdisciplinary approach involving an Australian university, the Singapore Ministry of Education, the Singapore National Arts Council, a community music association, and a local primary school. The Project engages young school children with Nanyin music, an ancient musical art form from China, and works with practicing Nanyin musicians and their musical practices. The Project integrates music into the regular music curriculum for an entire ten-week term, and incorporates a National Education focus with an interdisciplinary approach, encouraging students to make connections with subjects such as language, mathematics and social studies. The Project culminates with a public performance of Nanyin music by the participating students and an exhibition of their project work. This paper will also present the viability and usefulness of the Project from the perspectives of Nanyin musicians and school participants. (Contains 5 figures.)

description1282=The first in the Asian series on experiments and innovations in education, this study describes the historical background generating the present Singapore education system and provides a detailed report on reform and changes introduced in the past ten years. Innovations have occurred in curriculum development where secondary education received more flexibility, a broader subject-matter base, fewer exams, and increased extra-curricular activities. An unplanned, unsystematic teacher education program was structured into a planned curriculum with behavioral objectives to develop professional competence. Innovation in the integration policy brought two languages into one common curriculum. Other areas of innovation include the development of educational technology, expansion of secondary technical training, and the development of educational research. The characteristics of change in Singapore are seen in purposefulness, connectedness, and pragmatism progressing through four stages of initiation, interpretation, implementation, and correction.

In their operations in China, however, they have had an opportunity to utilize tanks much more extensively than elsewhere because of the character of the terrain and the large areas over which the fighting has occurred. As a matter of fact, China has been the great proving ground for Japanese armored vehicles of all types. The Japanese also used light and medium tanks to some extent in the Malayan campaign and in the siege of Singapore, as well as in the Philippines, Burma, Guadalcanal, and Papua. More recently, on Guam and Tinian, comparatively large numbers of Japanese tanks have been in action; on Saipan more than 80 were destroyed, many by aerial and naval bombardment before they could be moved from assembly areas."

description1268=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Purpose\: The study aims to describe the characteristics and etiologic causes of intermediate uveitis (IU) patients seen by a tertiary eye center in Singapore over 8 years. Methods\: This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of consecutive new cases of IU that presented to the uveitis subspecialty clinic from 2004–2011 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Data collected included demographics, clinical and laboratory findings. Diagnoses were based on standardized clinical history, ophthalmological examination and investigations. Results\: There were 66 new cases of IU, comprising 5.7% of 1168 new uveitis patients. The median age of diagnosis was 40 years (mean 39.4±15.9), with largest subgroup of the patients in the age group of 41–60 years (36.4%). The majority was Chinese (57.6%), followed by Asian Indians (18.2%) and Malays (16.7%). The ethnicity distribution was dissimilar to our ethnic distribution in Singapore (p
description1267=This article is from The World Allergy Organization Journal , volume 2 . Abstract \: Background\: A recent study by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood has shown that asthma symptom prevalence is still increasing in parts of Asia. As such, it is important to know how well asthma is being managed. Practices of physicians in India, China, Sri Lanka, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, and Taiwan in monitoring and treating childhood asthma were examined. Methods\: A 6-page standardized questionnaire was sent to physicians via post. The questionnaire is made up of 3 parts, including (1) methods of monitoring of childhood asthma, (2) practices in managing acute asthma exacerbations, and (3) choice of therapy in maintenance treatment. Results\: Our study reflects mostly the practices of physicians who practice in urban regions. Of respondents, 41.4% were general pediatricians, whereas 26.3% were general practitioners. A small fraction of physicians used score cards or diaries to monitor asthma, ranging from 0% (Philippines and Australia) to 15.9% (India). Only 8.1% (Sri Lanka) to 52.0% (Australia) use either a peak flow meter and/or spirometry to monitor asthma. However, for frequency of use, 35% (China) to 94% (Indonesia) never or seldom make use of a peak flow meter, and 33% (China) to 97.6% (Indonesia) never or seldom use spirometry for monitoring. Most physicians treat acute asthma appropriately with short-acting bronchodilators. For maintenance treatment, an inhaled corticosteroid was the most frequently chosen first-choice therapy. However, a significant fraction of physicians chose a long-acting β-agonist monotherapy as a first-choice treatment for asthma maintenance. For infants, the percentage ranged from 1.4% (Australia) to 76.3% (Indonesia); in preschoolers, 1.8% (Australia) to 43.3% (Indonesia); and in older children, 0% (Philippines) to 28.8% (Indonesia). These results may be related to the overall affluence of each nation. Conclusions\: There is much room for improvement in increasing physicians' awareness to guidelines for more effective management of pediatric asthma in Southeast Asia, especially regarding the high use of long-acting β-agonist monotherapy, even in young children.

description1265=Government matching fund programs, at their most fundamental level, are state-based initiatives that match private donations to colleges and universities with public funds. These programs have proven to be effective methods of improving public colleges and universities and successful examples of public-private partnerships, which are key components of new funding models for education not only in the United States, but also elsewhere around the world. These programs supply public funds that supplement state-provided resources in support of public colleges and universities in general. This report and the research it reflects focus on government matching fund programs in the United States, Canada, Singapore, and Hong Kong--all of which have documented histories of such initiatives. In Singapore and Hong Kong, where postsecondary institutions are relatively few in number and generally similar in organization and structure, public matching fund programs have been developed and implemented at the federal levels of government. In the United States and Canada, where higher education institutions are numerous and highly diverse, government matching fund programs have been designed and carried out at state and province levels. Consequently, programs in the United States and Canada differ greatly in their design, implementation, and oversight. The success of government matching fund programs varies from program to program because of their unique characteristics and implementation schemes. They include the amount of available public funds, the health of the larger economy in a particular society or community, institutional capabilities, and to lesser degrees, legislative and political climates, the state of philanthropic giving in general, and applicable tax laws. The report concludes that government matching fund programs offer great promise for strengthening the quality of higher education and improving access to colleges and universities. The most successful programs challenge institutions and their supporters and have been responsible for launching comprehensive fund-raising campaigns, for supporting existing campus programs, and for enhancing overall private giving. A 2002 Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB) report states, "The history of American philanthropy suggests that donors will make private gifts to higher education without the incentive of a matching fund program. However, an opportunity to double or, in some cases, triple the dollar value of a gift provides donors with powerful incentives." Elsewhere, in places such as Hong Kong and Singapore with different and less explicit philanthropic traditions, donors have responded to the chance to increase the impact of their money in a similar way. The Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) can see no reason why the introduction of a matched grants program in the United Kingdom should not be similarly rewarding. [The Council for Advancement and Support of Education is the largest international association of education institutions, serving more than 3,200 universities, colleges, independent schools, and related organizations in more than 40 countries. CASE is the leading resource for professional development, information, and standards in the fields of education fund raising, communications and marketing, and alumni relations. This report was prepared by CASE for the Sutton Trust.]

description1239=This article is from PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases , volume 8 . Abstract Tropical pathogens often cause febrile illnesses in humans and are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. The similarities in clinical symptoms provoked by these pathogens make diagnosis difficult. Thus, early, rapid and accurate diagnosis will be crucial in patient management and in the control of these diseases. In this study, a microfluidic lab-on-chip integrating multiplex molecular amplification and DNA microarray hybridization was developed for simultaneous detection and species differentiation of 26 globally important tropical pathogens. The analytical performance of the lab-on-chip for each pathogen ranged from 102 to 103 DNA or RNA copies. Assay performance was further verified with human whole blood spiked with Plasmodium falciparum and Chikungunya virus that yielded a range of detection from 200 to 4×105 parasites, and from 250 to 4×107 PFU respectively. This lab-on-chip was subsequently assessed and evaluated using 170 retrospective patient specimens in Singapore and Thailand. The lab-on-chip had a detection sensitivity of 83.1% and a specificity of 100% for P. falciparum; a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 99.3% for P. vivax; a positive 90.0% agreement and a specificity of 100% for Chikungunya virus; and a positive 85.0% agreement and a specificity of 100% for Dengue virus serotype 3 with reference methods conducted on the samples. Results suggested the practicality of an amplification microarray-based approach in a field setting for high-throughput detection and identification of tropical pathogens.
description1238=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Copy number variation (CNV) has been recognized as a major contributor to human genome diversity. It plays an important role in determining phenotypes and has been associated with a number of common and complex diseases. However CNV data from diverse populations is still limited. Here we report the first investigation of CNV in the indigenous populations from Peninsular Malaysia. We genotyped 34 Negrito genomes from Peninsular Malaysia using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray and identified 48 putative novel CNVs, consisting of 24 gains and 24 losses, of which 5 were identified in at least 2 unrelated samples. These CNVs appear unique to the Negrito population and were absent in the DGV, HapMap3 and Singapore Genome Variation Project (SGVP) datasets. Analysis of gene ontology revealed that genes within these CNVs were enriched in the immune system (GO\:0002376), response to stimulus mechanisms (GO\:0050896), the metabolic pathways (GO\:0001852), as well as regulation of transcription (GO\:0006355). Copy number gains in CNV regions (CNVRs) enriched with genes were significantly higher than the losses (P value

description1228=The properties of nanostructured films can be tailored by many factors such as composition, structure, preferred orientation, microstructure, interphase interface and grain boundaries. Compositional control of magnetic properties of recording media depends on the miscibility of constituent elements. However, for nanostructured materials with a large surface-to-volume ratio of atoms, the miscibility at the nanoscale may not necessarily follow the prediction of conventional phase diagram that does not consider the effects of surface and interface. This limitation further complicates the prediction of phase separation at grain boundaries and interphase interface. Using anomalous x-ray scattering the alloying and composition of a specific long range order of textured nanostructured films has been investigated. Such information may not be readily available from conventional characterization techniques.

description1224=This paper describes the impact of three early childhood education research programs in Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia, and funded by the Bernard van Leer Foundation. The Mount Druitt Project in Australia has implemented institution- and home-based educational programs, which also monitor children's physical development and work closely with parents. One of the most important outcomes has been the spread of preschools into the Government system, especially in disadvantaged areas. There has been little short-term effect on school performance; lasting effects are more closely related to social and attitudinal development than to cognitive variables. The Singapore Project is a 9-year longitudinal study investigating cognitive and social development in preschoolers in three 3-year phases\: (1) collecting baseline data on the normative development of 3,000 preschoolers; (2) providing center-based intervention focusing on English language skills; and (3) developing a closer home-school-society relationship. This project provided the first comprehensive data on social and cognitive development of Singapore children, provided intensive training programs for practitioners in approximately 40 preschools, and developed effective parent and community involvement strategies. The Malaysian study investigated the development of over 3,000 preschoolers from various sections of Malaysian society. Findings indicated that urban advantaged children were more advanced in physical, cognitive, language, and socio-emotional development than were children from other groups. Estate children were the least advanced and rural children and urban disadvantaged did not differ from each other. Changes in child-rearing practices and preschool education were recommended to alleviate some of the differences among the groups. (KDFB)

description1202=As counterfeiting continue to grow in the market and could hardly be recognized with the advancement of technology, new places which are least expected to house large counterfeiting manufacturers are being revealed. The latest to join the list is Pakistan. Pakistan's bustling markets are filled with kiosk after kiosk selling pills, capsules, tablets, and syrups of all types, for every type of ailment. It's almost impossible to tell which ones are genuine, and which are potentially deadly fakes. Just like other cities found to be the hub of counterfeiting (Jakarta, Indonesia had been the latest before the gray markets of Pakistan were found), fraudsters hide beneath the conundrum of a developing nation. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that as many as one million people die every year worldwide from ingesting counterfeit medications. In Pakistan, in 2012, in one incident alone, 120 people died after taking counterfeit heart medicine. These medicines may not have any active ingredient of active substance that can cure the disease but are brought anyway because of cheaper price. According to the Peterson Group, a non-profit organization campaigning against counterfeit medicines and its proliferation, these scammers transfer from one country to another once that their current post has been determined. With the lack of security in the country that they transfer into, they have the advantage to leave without any trace and with ease. Sometimes, they even get assistance from the authorities just with the help of a little bribery. There are also times when the fraudsters do not work with a big bogus operation. Because of the demand and the harshness of life, they are forced to sell counterfeit medicines with little understanding of how they could negatively impact another person’s health and life. In CNN’s exclusive interview with one of the makers and vendors of counterfeited medicines, he explained, “We make everything here, whatever is in high demand in the market place”. The report continues, “The dusty, dirty operation moves swiftly as the man continues his show and tell ‘In all of these capsules and bottles we put the same ingredients. And all of the syrup is the same syrup. Only the color is different’”. Although the country has already created Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan since 2010, the problem is still massive. 45-50% of Pakistani drugs were fake or of substandard quality. The government is currently being asked of their side of the story but has but has not yet responded.

description1193=With the recent recognition by the Singapore government that the country's education system must change radically to meet the challenges of the new millennium, all levels of education, from primary to tertiary, in all areas, have been undergoing close scrutiny and restructuring. Three educational initiatives recently have been launched, emphasizing creative thinking, the use of information technology, and national education in all subjects. This paper looks at the incoming changes in the area of secondary and tertiary art education and examines the various, and often complex, factors for and against their successful implementation.

description1192=Research on staff development suggests that teachers are more likely to benefit from training if they are able to learn on their own. This paper examines staff development for early childhood professionals, focusing on the need for an individualized approach and applying the findings to preschool education in Singapore. The paper considers the evolution of staff development from a patchwork of courses and workshops into a systematic plan of professional growth and maintains that early childhood educators need further professional training beyond their initial degree. In addition, the paper points to the importance of opportunities for early childhood teachers to reflect upon their teaching and to assess their ability to cope with classroom problems. The paper identifies an individualized approach to staff development that considers the organizational dynamics of the school as the most effective approach. A 5-step process of individualized staff development as described by D. Clough (1991) is summarized\: (1) teacher/principal planning conference; (2) professional growth activities; (3) progress update conference; (4) continued professional growth activities; and (5) summative teacher/principal conference. The paper concludes by noting that an individualized approach to early childhood teachers' professional development offers an alternative to the traditional inservice training program. (KB)

description1188=This article is from Journal of Gynecologic Oncology , volume 25 . Abstract Objective\: To evaluate uterine and ovarian cancer mortality trends in East Asian countries. Methods\: For three Asian countries and one region (Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong), we extracted number of deaths for each year from the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database, focusing on women ≥20 years old. The WHO population data were used to estimate person-years at risk for women. The annual age-standardized, truncated rates were evaluated for four age groups. We also compared age-specific mortality rates during three calendar periods (1979 to 1988, 1989 to 1998, and 1999 to 2010). Joinpoint regression was used to determine secular trends in mortality. To obtain cervical and uterine corpus cancer mortality rates in Korea, we re-allocated the cases with uterine cancer of unspecified subsite according to the proportion in the National Cancer Incidence Databases. Results\: Overall, uterine cancer mortality has decreased in each of the Asian regions. In Korea, corrected cervical cancer mortality has declined since 1993, at an annual percentage change (APC) of -4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.3 to -4.4). On the other hand, corrected uterine corpus cancer mortality has abruptly increased since 1995 (APC, 6.7; 95% CI, 5.4 to 8.0). Ovarian cancer mortality was stable, except in Korea, where mortality rates steadily increased at an APC of 6.2% (95% CI, 3.4 to 9.0) during 1995 to 2000, and subsequently stabilized. Conclusion\: Although uterine cancer mortality rates are declining in East Asia, additional effort is warranted to reduce the burden of gynecologic cancer in the future, through the implementation of early detection programs and the use of optimal therapeutic strategies.

description1185=Thousands of packets of medicines go in and out of international boundaries every day. With the outbreak of counterfeit medicine, importation and exportation of medicines may now present great dangers and additional hazards. The issue of importation is intertwined with the potential for counterfeit drugs and several other regulatory challenges that should be brought to light. If counterfeit medicine is smuggled into a country, the issue of security will surely be pulled into the matter until eventually the competence of government will also be dragged. Fundamentally, counterfeiting is not a local or a single country problem, but is a global issue which makes it even harder to restrain. In developed countries, preventive measures are already being undergone to counter illegal importation within their boundaries. The issue lies on the number of fraud medicines entering nations which have lack of security. World Health Organization (WHO) is mostly concerned on the importation of counterfeit medicines than illegal drugs which contain opium, nicotine and other illegal substances. Liability concerns are raised for consumers, manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and other involved entities. To effectively address issues of safety, and by the same token, counterfeits and importation, there must be a closed distribution chain without a gray market, electronic tracking and trace security features must be implemented, and tougher penalties and better enforcement of sanctions against counterfeiters must be put into place. To protect the public from the threat of incidentally purchasing counterfeit medicines , international health movements, together with the World Health Organization and other Non-profit organizations such as The Peterson Group, WHO requires that prescription drugs be shown to local authorities and undergo quality testing through anti-counterfeit technologies that are distributed to hundreds of pharmacies, hospitals and clinics. Throughout the drug approval process, pharmaceutical manufacturers must prove that they can consistently produce medications of expected strength, quality, and purity. WHO also reviews labeling to ensure healthcare professionals and patients have the information necessary to understand a drug's risks and proper use. The following are the pressing concerns that pattern countries with similar issues   1. Quality Assurance Concerns  Each and every pharmaceutical company undergoes sufficient quality assurance and should have an appointed team dedicated for quality control. However, with the pressing issue of counterfeiting, even pharmacies are being doubted to dispense medicines which have never passed quality assurance. This is a grave concern in Jakarta, Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand  2. Presence of untested substance   Imported medications and their ingredients, although legal in foreign countries, may not have been evaluated for safety and effectiveness with the same rigor we use for drug approval in the U.S. These products may be addictive or contain other dangerous substances.

description1180=The growing occurrence of natural calamities and disasters has provided many entrepreneurs and government people to innovate in terms of relief and emergency response solutions. Although such events as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions cannot be predicted accurately, the public can be encouraged to prepare for any eventuality and to address immediate risks in order to preserve life and reduce damage to property. Public safety is a primary concern not just of the government authorities but also of every individual and family. This is where technology can serve a vital role in increasing the public’s capability to manage risks due to natural as well as human-induced disasters (economic collapse, massive unemployment, terrorist attacks, etc.). Having a life-support during any emergency situation can help people to cope and to move on with confidence and greater determination to improve our collective effort to support and secure the community. MWI’s Unified Message Switch (UMS) allows users to send messages in various social media formats in one unified infrastructure, providing efficient and faster transmission. Such a facility becomes an advantage when it comes to vital communication links related to disaster management and other rapid-response situations. And even in ordinary communication needs, in business and social media, having this capability allows greater advantage and adaptability to specific messaging requirements in areas as medical service, transportation, construction and police work.  Public safety is of utmost importance; and prevention, as it is often said, beats having to manage or minimize damages due to natural or human-induced disasters. Communication plays a crucial role in this goal to ensure that any risks to public safety be anticipated and managed with the least amount of time, cost and damage as possible. MWI Consultant’s has ten years of solid experience in “designing and deploying successful and highly reliable solutions”. Their team is “committed to give every customer the best service based on (their) shared values and trust”.

description1178=On January 20, 2016, Singapore deposited with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) its instrument of ratification for the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, reports Lowtax.net. With this development, Singapore became the 93rd jurisdiction to join the pact, touted by the OECD as the world's leading instrument for boosting transparency and combating offshore tax evasion. The Convention provides for all forms of administrative assistance in tax matters \: exchange of information on request, spontaneous exchange, automatic exchange, tax examinations abroad, simultaneous tax examinations, and assistance in tax collection. It guarantees extensive safeguards for the protection of taxpayers' rights. Ratifying the Convention will expand Singapore's network of partners for the exchange of information on request by 34 jurisdictions. This is part of a series of changes that Singapore has made in recent years to combat cross-border tax evasion, following Singapore's adoption of the internationally agreed standard for exchange of information on request in 2009, Singapore's Ministry of Finance said. Minister for Finance, Heng Swee Keat, said\: "Ratifying the Convention reflects Singapore's commitment to effective exchange of information based on international standards, but the standards can only work if all financial centres, such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, Singapore, and Hong Kong, move together. We will continue to work with our international partners to achieve this and prevent regulatory arbitrage." The Convention was developed jointly by the OECD and the Council of Europe in 1988. It was amended in 2010 to respond to a call by the Group of Twenty (G-20) nations that it be aligned to the new international standard on the automatic exchange of information and that it be opened up to all countries. The Convention is now seen as the instrument for swift implementation of the new Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters developed by the OECD. It will also be critical for the automatic exchange of country-by-country reports, proposed in the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting project.
description1177=Using a Vygotskian perspective, the researchers investigated the interaction of secondary school language learners engaged in a dictogloss task that called for collaborative reconstruction of a text. The investigation focused on the students' behaviors that were detrimental to effective interaction and made it less likely that students would be able to provide scaffolded help for the other member of their dyad. Participants in the study were 19 English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) learners from China and Korea who were studying at a girls' secondary school in Singapore. Data sources were transcripts of one dyad's interaction, student journals, questionnaires, and interviews. A wide range of detrimental behaviors were displayed by the participants in the current study. However, the overall picture provided by the data suggests that with help from educators, students can become more skilled at assisting one another and more willing to do so. Ideas are put forward as to how educators can supply such help. (Contains 28 references.) (Author/KFT)

Service in the real estate has grown rapidly not just in volume with the corresponding population growth but also in terms of the efficiency as well as the innovativeness required by discriminating clients. With decreasing costs of materials to replace traditional materials, such as concrete, steel and lumber, which are equally or even more durable and, more importantly, easier and less costly to install and maintain, consumers and institutional users are gradually choosing to follow the trends toward innovative and economical choices. Along with these changes in the real estate and construction industry also come innovations in management, disposal, rental and maintenance of properties.

description1167=English as a foreign/second language teaching (ELT) is notably successful in some national public educational systems and unsuccessful in others. Holland, Singapore and Sweden are outstanding examples of great success in the strategic management of ELT in their public educational systems. General failures abound, particularly in countries that rank well below Holland, Singapore and Sweden socio-economically. The focus of this article is on the English language situation in Mexico, one of those countries, and representative of most of Latin America and other parts of the developing world. After providing evidence that the results of ELT in the Mexican public educational system are indeed generally extremely poor, the article addresses two main questions\: Why is that so? How could that general failure be shifted to significant success? Two alternative responses to the general failure of ELT in the Mexican public educational system are suggested. They might be worth considering for some other countries' public educational system ELT also. (Contains 3 figures and 5 notes.)

description1164=Background\: Singapore education adopted nurturing creativity and developing creativity efficacy among their students and children. This study investigated Singapore high school students' creativity efficacy based on the contemporary model of creativity (Amabile, 1983, 1996), self efficacy (Bandura, 1989, 1997) and inclusion education. Aims\: Creativity efficacy of high school students was measured. Five scales were developed with reference to the context of learning of the participants\: creativity self-efficacy (cognitive style), creativity self-efficacy (working style and personality trait), domain-specific efficacy with reference to everyday problem solving, civic responsibility and intercultural relationship. Sample\: The participants were 510 high school students (46.5%, girls). The age range of the students was between 12 and 18 years old (M \= 15.43 years old and SD \= 0.87 years old). Method\: The questionnaire survey was distributed to the participants who rated their responses on a five point Likert scale with anchors "1" "very much unlike me", "2" "unlike me", "3" "moderately like me", "4" "like me" and "5" "very much like me". Results\: Alpha reliabilities of all the scales were high, between 0.7 and 0.9, indicating the presence of internal consistency. Significant correlations were observed among creativity self-efficacy (working style and personality trait), creativity self-efficacy (cognitive style), and everyday problem solving efficacy. Exploratory factor analysis on the scales yielded one factor, creativity efficacy, accounted for 54.1% of variance. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to all subscales resulted in one factor model, with high fit indexes (0.98) and Cronbach's alpha (0.76). Conclusion\: Singaporean high school students' scored moderately high for creativity efficacy, 80.5 (the lowest being 33, and the highest, 115). No significant gender difference was observed. Implications of the results of the study were discussed with reference to developing efficacies in the context of creativity education in Asian and Chinese societies. (Contains 3 tables.)

description1152=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Illicit trade carries the potential to magnify existing tobacco-related health care costs through increased availability of untaxed and inexpensive cigarettes. What is known with respect to the magnitude of illicit trade for Vietnam is produced primarily by the industry, and methodologies are typically opaque. Independent assessment of the illicit cigarette trade in Vietnam is vital to tobacco control policy. This paper measures the magnitude of illicit cigarette trade for Vietnam between 1998 and 2010 using two methods, discrepancies between legitimate domestic cigarette sales and domestic tobacco consumption estimated from surveys, and trade discrepancies as recorded by Vietnam and trade partners. The results indicate that Vietnam likely experienced net smuggling in during the period studied. With the inclusion of adjustments for survey respondent under-reporting, inward illicit trade likely occurred in three of the four years for which surveys were available. Discrepancies in trade records indicate that the value of smuggled cigarettes into Vietnam ranges from $100 million to $300 million between 2000 and 2010 and that these cigarettes primarily originate in Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Malaysia, and Australia. Notable differences in trends over time exist between the two methods, but by comparison, the industry estimates consistently place the magnitude of illicit trade at the upper bounds of what this study shows. The unavailability of annual, survey-based estimates of consumption may obscure the true, annual trend over time. Second, as surveys changed over time, estimates relying on them may be inconsistent with one another. Finally, these two methods measure different components of illicit trade, specifically consumption of illicit cigarettes regardless of origin and smuggling of cigarettes into a particular market. However, absent a gold standard, comparisons of different approaches to illicit trade measurement serve efforts to refine and improve measurement approaches and estimates.

description1149=A study of individual variability in second-language learners' performance in specific classroom tasks is presented as evidence that instruction in language for special purposes (LSP) has an important role to play. Subjects were 17 Singapore university students in a remedial English course; all had studied English since elementary school. The subjects performed four tasks\: a language test; an essay; an interview; and a peer-group discussion. Performance on each tasks was analyzed for patterns of use of simple present, simple past, and present perfect tenses. Accuracy rates reflect variability in use of the tenses. Results indicate that the accuracy rate was highest for the discussion tasks, and lower for essay, interview, and language test, in descending order of accuracy. These figures suggest that use of tense/aspect varies across tasks. Further, contextual analysis of task performance looked at verb usage within four categories of context (verbal aspect, adverbials, serialization, implicit reference) for each task type. The verbal aspect category was found most problematic, followed by adverbials, serialization, and implicit reference in descending order. Overall, results indicate that context influences task accuracy rate, suggesting that LSP, which is context-based, is an important way to teach second languages. (MSE)
description1148=This paper explores how looking at the lived time of secondary school students in Singapore has generated questions for curricular theory and practice. In-depth interviews, three of which are described, show the intersection of temporality and lived experience. Students are aware of rational, clock time, but seem to understand that there is an experience of time that goes beyond clock time. Singapore educators have been concerned with the lack of historical consciousness among their young people, and have proposed curricular revisions to bring about an awareness of Singapores past development. In the rush into organizing the learning and lives of young people, this paper challenges educators to look at temporality in its textured detail to consider how its lived materiality might generate new questions for curricular theory and practice. What time means to students must also be considered in educational planning. (Contains 22 references.) (SLD)

description1144=With the various uses of formaldehyde, eye and skin contact is a potential occurrence, therefore a safety shower or eyewash should be provided. Formaldehyde is just one of many chemical substances that could come in contact with the eyes or body, requiring emergency response equipment to be readily available. Formaldehyde is back in the news now that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a new rule to control formaldehyde emissions from certain products. However, if your facility uses formaldehyde, as an environment, health, and safety (EHS) manager you have been required for a long time to safeguard your workers from formaldehyde exposure under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) workplace safety requirements. Today we will offer some tips for working safely with formaldehyde . Formaldehyde is a fairly common chemical substance.  It’s used to make clothing, textiles, furniture, and building products.  It’s also a by-product of some forms of combustion. Formaldehyde is well known as a preservative in medical laboratories, as an embalming fluid, and as a sterilizer. In addition, OSHA has found that some hair smoothing products may contain formaldehyde, may release formaldehyde at levels above OSHA’s permissible limits during use, and may be mislabeled, all of which can pose health risks to salon workers. For airborne formaldehyde, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) is just 0.75 parts per million (ppm) of air over an 8-hour time-weighted average. Most protective measures have to be instituted at the OSHA action level of 0.5 ppm for an 8-hour time-weighted average and/or the short-term exposure limit (STEL) of 2 ppm for 15 minutes. While formaldehyde’s most serious hazards relate to health, there are others. Exposing it to heat or flame can cause a fire or explosion, depending on how much formaldehyde a solution contains.  Formaldehyde is also reactive with a number of substances.  You risk a violent reaction if you mix it with strong oxidizers. In addition, you’ll get explosive compounds if you mix it with nitrogen oxide, nitromethane, perchloric acid and aniline, or peroxyformic acid. Nine Tips for Working with Formaldehyde Tip 1\: Identify exposure risks. There are a number of ways to identify potential formaldehyde exposure risks.  First, formaldehyde has a pungent odor that’s easy to recognize.  It also often causes eye irritation.  That’s one identifier, but you can’t depend on it.  People often get used to the smell and eye irritation and stop noticing it. Checking the label and safety data sheet (SDS) before using any substance will also alert you to formaldehyde.  At the very least, it will be listed on the label.  If the substance can release formaldehyde at levels above 0.5 ppm, the label must list all hazards, including respiratory sensitization and the words “May Cause Cancer.” Tip 2\: Wear the PPE. Always wear the personal protective equipment (PPE) that’s assigned, and inspect it carefully before use. If it gets contaminated, don’t take it home.  It has to be cleaned or laundered before reuse. Remove it in the change room, and put it in a container labeled for formaldehyde. Tip 3\: Prevent releases. To prevent formaldehyde releases, OSHA also requires regular container inspections to look for leaks and spills.  Potential spill areas have to be designed for containment and decontamination.  Only trained, properly equipped people repair leaks and clean up spills.  Dispose of contaminated waste and debris in sealed containers with formaldehyde hazard warning labels. Tip 4\: Prevent fires. Formaldehyde is extremely flammable. Do not use near open flames or in places where there is the potential for sparks. Do not smoke in areas where formaldehyde is used. In case of a fire, shut off supply. If possible and there is no risk to surroundings, let the fire burn itself out. In other cases extinguish with powder or carbon dioxide. Tip 4\: Prevent explosions. Formaldehyde mixes well with air and explosive mixtures are formed easily. You can prevent explosions by using formaldehyde only in a closed system with proper ventilation. Make sure the electrical equipment and lighting in areas where formaldehyde is used is explosionproof. In case of a fire in a cylinder holding formaldehyde, you can help avoid an explosion by keeping the cylinder cool by spraying with water. Tip 5\: Respond in case of inhalation.  Get a formaldehyde inhalation victim to fresh air immediately.  Rescuers must wear self-containing breathing apparatus (SCBA) to enter an area with very high formaldehyde concentrations.  Keep the person warm and at rest and give artificial respiration if breathing has stopped.  Get immediate medical attention. Serious coughing or upper respiratory irritation may require hospitalization for observation. Tip 6\: Respond in case of ingestion. Give a conscious victim milk or water to dilute the formaldehyde.  Keep the person warm and at rest; for vomiting, keep the head below the hips. Get immediate medical attention. Tip 7\: Respond in case of skin contact. Remove contaminated clothing. Shower immediately after skin contact. Rinse with soap and lots of water for at least 15 minutes. Cover a skin or eye burn with a sterile bandage and get immediate medical attention.  Also get checked if you have any notable eye or respiratory irritation. Tip 8\: Respond in case of eye contact. Use eyewash immediately after eye contact. Use large amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses if easily possible. Get immediate medical attention. Tip 9\:  Provide training. OSHA’s formaldehyde standard requires employers to train all employees who are assigned to work areas with the potential for formaldehyde exposure at or above 0.1 ppm. Employees must be trained at the time of initial assignment and at least once a year thereafter. They must also receive training whenever a new exposure to formaldehyde is introduced into the work area.

description1142=The interpretation of information and the generation of knowledge is dependent on the existing metaphorical conceptual frameworks or mental models of the learner. Metaphorical mental models are both a method of representing and a way of organizing knowledge, and summarize an individual's beliefs about a system. Since the particular metaphors underlying an individual's understanding of the Internet serve to stimulate or limit the human imagination, it is essential to explore students' mental models in order to appropriately design the learning experience. Following a review of previous research eliciting metaphorical models or conceptions of the Internet, a structured questionnaire was developed and used to explore the metaphors employed by a sample of pre-service teachers in Singapore; this provided insights into their conceptual understanding of the nature and uses of the Internet. Findings indicate that the Internet is perceived more as a depository of information (passive) rather than as an interactive environment (active). The "Metaphors of Internet Questionnaire" is appended. (Author/AEF)

description1140=Buying a home insurance in Singapore can be considered as one of the best decisions that you can take in your life. That’s because the home insurance can come to your survival during a storm, earthquake, robbery, theft or any similar situation. Therefore, getting a home insurance in Singapore cannot be considered as an unnecessary waste of your hard earned money. However, you need to pay attention towards a variety of factors when you are obtaining a home insurance in Singapore. Most importantly, you need to consider about the policy rates. Policy rates are affected by several factors such as the construction type, age and location of your property. The insurance companies in Singapore believe that the newer homes are less vulnerable to damages. As a result, you will have to pay a lower premium when you are obtaining a home insurance for a newer home. It is a good idea to shop around, bundle your policy and add safety features when you are getting a home insurance to keep peace of mind in the long run. However, with Bricon Associates , from as low as $5 per month, you can protect your home assets and family. With our home insurance, your dearest Singapore home and loved ones can be protected against fire, lightning, theft, flood and many more. With the plans we offer, you can enjoy premium discounts with enhanced coverage of the original sum insured for your assets.

description1139=In 1985, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) Childcare Services of Singapore started an experimental project designed to develop an alternative model of child care. The resulting project, the Community Childcare Center (CCC), differs from regular child care centers in that it\: (1) is cheaper; (2) involves considerable community participation; and (3) serves both children in the child care center and other children in the community. The CCC is based on a tripartite model that involves the government, the NTUC, and the community. The government provides the capital needed to set up child care centers and subsidies. The NTUC provides the framework, structure, and professional expertise for operating the centers and coordinating the program. The community provides feedback, volunteers, and a network of support and resources. This paper discusses the history of institutionalized child care in Singapore, current child care services, challenges facing child care centers, responsibilities for child care, the alternative Community Childcare Model and the roles of its participants, and strategies for community involvement.

description1137=A group of high ability students (n \= 32) described the qualities of their most effective teachers through a written essay. Analysis of the essays identified 30 different themes within four domains. These themes were used to construct a Likert scale survey and an ipsative comparison which were both administered to 42 teachers and 300 students at a secondary school for high ability female students in Singapore. Results show that, while there are similarities, there are also statistically significant differences between the qualities of effective teachers as perceived by teachers and students. In addition, the results also show that students demonstrate a preference for teachers' personality and socio-emotional qualities over their classroom management skills, thinking skills or moral and ethical qualities.

description1136=There has been a long held perception that the field of mathematics is more appropriate for males than for females. The construct, mathematics as a male domain, has been considered a critical variable in explanations for females' under-representation in the most demanding mathematics subjects offered at school and higher education, and in related careers. The widely used Fennema-Sherman Mathematics attitude scales [MAS] consist of nine subscales including Mathematics as a male domain [MD]. It has recently been argued that the content of some of the MD items is anachronistic and that responses to others can no longer be reliably interpreted. Two versions of a new scale, loosely based on the MD, have been developed and trialed in Australia and Singapore with students in grades 7 to 10. In this paper, the researchers present general findings which indicate changes in perceptions about some aspects of the gendering of mathematics, discuss the similarities and differences in the perceptions of students in the two countries, and the implications of the results obtained for equity in mathematics education. The overall findings contribute an important dimension to the debate in contemporary society on concerns about the educational disadvantage of boys. (Contains 22 references.) (Author/BT)

description1135=This paper seeks to explore how beginning elementary school teachers (N\=161) in Singapore conceive the scope and nature of science and to understand the relationship between those views and their present approach to, as well as their past experience of, science teaching and learning. Results of an inquiry into the teachers' views indicate that these views are generally piecemeal and may not form coherent conceptual systems. These views are also at variance with those philosophical and historical views that are proposed by Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, and Feyerabend. Some epistemological obstacles towards a constructivist pedagogy are discussed. Based on one model of teacher education and professional development, some suggestions on how teachers can consciously monitor and develop their pedagogy are provided. The findings provide a knowledge base for a more systematic intervention study in the local context in the future. (Author/IAH)

description1133=Last August 12, 2015, a 12 year old boy added to the list of art fumblers when he accidently tripped and punched a hole on a 350 year old canvass of Paolo Porpora called Flowers. The painting was valued at $1.5 million dollars.  Nervous and awkward, the boy and his family is not required to pay the damage, with the curator stating that it is, after all, covered by insurance. Accidents like these happen unexpectedly. With the increasing interest in artworks investments, insuring your art pieces can assist you in case you have recover the damage. Axis Capital Inc., with years of experience of handling artworks in Bermuda, Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, explains that property insurance follow the same procedure as homeowners or theft insurances. Here are the following steps to insure your art pieces\: 1. Know which premium to pay Agents may be able to help you know which specific plan to get. Since antiques and paintings each have different premiums, you have to know which is fit for your pieces. Make sure to know what the inclusions are. If you are planning to insure a whole bunch of artworks, you are likely to get specialist insurance. If you only have one or two masterpieces to cover, home policy may be able to include those in your provision.  2. Get the Exact Price to Cover Historical pieces made by famous artist can get a cover of up to million dollars.  Make sure to discuss the exact figure of coverage with your insurance agent. Each year’s renewal can also be either depreciated or appraised depending on the value estimate and review of its market cost. Insurance companies use different measuring equipment to ensure the value the artwork. 3. Update you Cover When the artist dies, the value of the art should automatically increase by either 100% to 200% depending on the place you are in. In developing cities like Jakarta, Indonesia and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the value has increased from 50% to 150% within a year. In the event of an artist’s death you must review your sums insured within 12 months to ensure you have the right level of cover. 4. Clear Its Legitimacy It is a crime to incur stolen pieces of art, no matter how valuable they are.  It is important to know that your art piece was not previously stolen or is a product of fraudulence. The insurance only covers arts in good faith and not if it is a product of thievery.

description1130=Singapore, like Australia, is one of the world's most prosperous countries. However, the basis for Singapore's prosperity is quite different from that of Australia's and for this reason it provides an interesting and complementary case study. While much of Australia's current affluence flows from its rich endowment of mineral resources, Singapore's success builds on its geographical position, strong trading links and the innovative and entrepreneurial outlook of its government. Singapore provides an example of a country responding in a coherent and strategic way to its natural advantages and its lack of natural resources. An important part of this response has been to develop whole of government approaches to national development that focus on the need to build competitive advantage through innovation. Investment in education has responded to the needs of national development. The outcome has been a high quality but diverse system with specialised institutions using the best pedagogical approaches from around the world, each working to achieve its own clearly defined educational objectives. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role that universities have played in promoting Singapore's economic development and in particular to examine the importance of university business interactions in promoting the flow of information, ideas and technology.

description1128=This article is from BMC Genomics , volume 15 . Abstract Background\: The HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium (PASNP) has generated a genetic resource of almost 55,000 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across more than 1,800 individuals from 73 urban and indigenous populations in Asia. This has offered valuable insights into the correlation between the genetic ancestry of these populations with major linguistic systems and geography. Here, we attempt to understand whether adaptation to local climate, diet and environment partly explains the genetic variation present in these populations by investigating the genomic signatures of positive selection. Results\: To evaluate the impact to the selection analyses due to the considerably lower SNP density as compared to other population genetics resources such as the International HapMap Project (HapMap) or the Singapore Genome Variation Project, we evaluated the extent of haplotype phasing switch errors and the consistency of selection signals from three haplotype-based approaches (iHS, XP-EHH, haploPS) when the HapMap data is thinned to a similar density as PASNP. We subsequently applied haploPS to detect and characterize positive selection in the PASNP populations, identifying 59 genomics regions that were selected in at least one PASNP populations. A cluster analysis on the basis of these 59 signals showed that indigenous populations such as the Negrito from Malaysia and Philippines, the China Hmong, and the Taiwan Ami and Atayal shared more of these signals. We also reported evidence of a positive selection signal encompassing the beta globin gene in the Taiwan Ami and Atayal that was distinct from the signal in the HapMap Africans, suggesting the possibility of convergent evolution at this locus due to malarial selection. Conclusions\: We established that the lower SNP content of the PASNP data conferred weaker ability to detect signatures of positive selection, but the availability of the new approach haploPS retained modest power. Out of all the populations in PASNP, we identified only 59 signals, suggesting a strong need for high-density population-level genotyping data or sequencing data in order to achieve a comprehensive survey of positive selection in Asian populations.

description1126=Black is beautiful and these black sand beaches from around the world show how true this saying is. This Black Sand Beach, Lost Coast, California is so well-known for its black sand beach lies pristine and relatively untouched. It is 4,000 feet below the surrounding mountains of California. The remote beach is hard to reach and very hard to get in, the only way to get there is the small mountain roads. Camping as well as hiking are the two big things in this area. This is a perfect place to connect with nature.  You may have just found your new favorite beach in the world in Perissa, Santorini, Greece. With its crystal clear water and its smooth but devilishly hot sand you are sure to enjoy your getaway. It is known as one of the Greece’s best beaches and is protected by Mesa Vouno and the ruins of the ancient Spartan city Thera to the north. Enjoy a picture perfect scenic of the stark contrast between the black sand beach and the white buildings.Every tourist must experience the 3 kilometer hike to Mesa Vouno at dawn to take in a sunrise fit for the Gods, if not, your visit would be incomplete. Aside from the beauty of nature in Bali and the beauty of the city in Jakarta, there is the Black Sand Dive Retrest is a small 6-bungalow quality dive resort located on a sheltered bay in a natural setting on Lembeh Strait, Indonesia’s Exotic Critter Capital. The resort focuses on personalized service both above and below the water, offering an exceptional dive holiday experience in "The Mecca of Muck Diving" Lembeh Strait for our discerning guests. Visiting divers have very limited holiday time and staying here will worth every minute of the vacation. It is the incredible diving that draws visitors to Lembeh Strait. Vík Beach, Iceland is situatedat the southernmost point of Iceland. This is definitely one of the prettiest black sand beaches in the world. This stretch of black basalt sand is one of the wettest places in Iceland, getting about 90 inches of rain a year and is surrounded by volcanoes and glaciers – which if you ask us, makes for one heck of a unique destination. Punaluu Beach, Hawaiiis to be found on the Big Island. It is actually a result of lava that’s flowed to the ocean and cooled, creating a beautiful, but rocky beach. Be wary for sun-bathing Hawksbill and Green turtles, you’re on their turf after all. Be sure to stay at least 15 feet away from these endangered creatures otherwise the beach patrol might cut your visit short. Oh, and taking some of that stunning sand home with you as a memento isn’t allowed either. Travelling and having a vacation can sometimes be overwhelming and stressful. To avoid this kind of problem, make a research beforehand. How often is it that people became a victim of scam of false advertisements?

We introduce a strategy based on Kustin-Miller unprojection that constructs many hundreds of Gorenstein codimension 4 ideals with 9x16 resolutions (that is, 9 equations and 16 first syzygies). Our two basic games are called Tom and Jerry; the main application is the biregular construction of most of the anticanonically polarised Mori Fano 3-folds of Altinok's thesis. There are 115 cases whose numerical data (in effect, the Hilbert series) allow a Type I projection. In every case, at least one Tom and one Jerry construction works, providing at least two deformation families of quasismooth Fano 3-folds having the same numerics but different topology.

description1122=Twenty-one schools from the United States and Singapore participated in this evaluation of a high-school biology multimedia CD-ROM called BioBLAST[R]. Results include a summary of teacher descriptions of their curriculum-based justifications for using this software as well as a compilation of program features that teachers describe as facilitating successful implementation of new learning technologies. Analysis of teacher reports provides a profile of three types of strategies teachers used to implement the program. Analysis of student performance on pre/posttest shows how implementation strategies were associated with student gains in particular schools and classes. A comparison of student pre/posttest scores one year later with previous pre/posttest results suggests that changes in implementation strategies, teacher incentives, or a decrease in support services had a direct impact on student performance. Students with a wide range of prior knowledge were able to use the software and show performance gains appropriate to their knowledge level and experience. (Contains 10 references.) (Author/AEF)

description1120=This article is from Journal of Biomedical Science , volume 21 . Abstract Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a member of Picornaviridae that causes mild and self-limiting hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). However, EV71 infections can progress to polio-like paralysis, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and fatal encephalitis in infants and young children. Large EV71 outbreaks have been reported in Taiwan, China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia. This virus is considered a critical emerging public health threat. EV71 is an important crucial neurotropic enterovirus for which there is currently no effective antiviral drug or vaccine. The mechanism by which EV71 causes severe central nervous system complications remains unclear. The interaction between the virus and the host is vital for viral replication, virulence, and pathogenicity. SCARB2 or PSGL-1 receptor binding is the first step in the development of viral infections, and viral factors (e.g., 5′ UTR, VP1, 3C, 3D, 3′ UTR), host factors and environments (e.g., ITAFs, type I IFN) are also involved in viral infections. The tissue tropism and pathogenesis of viruses are determined by a combination of several factors. This review article provides a summary of host and virus factors affecting cell and tissue tropism and the pathogenesis of enteroviruses.

description1118=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Background\: In Singapore, as diabetes is an increasingly important public health issue, the cost-effectiveness of pursuing lifestyle modification programs and/or alternative prevention strategies is of critical importance for policymakers. While the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) compared weight loss through lifestyle modification with oral treatment of diabetes drug metformin to prevent/delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic subjects, no data on either the actual or potential cost effectiveness of such a program is available for East or South-east Asian populations. This study estimates the 3-year cost-effectiveness of lifestyle modification and metformin among pre-diabetic subjects from a Singapore health system and societal perspective. Methodology\: Cost effectiveness was analysed from 2010–2012 using a decision-based model to estimate the rates of getting diabetes, healthcare costs and health-related quality of life. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was estimated using costs relevant to the time horizon of the study from Singapore. All costs are expressed in 2012 US dollars. Principal Findings\: The total economic cost for non-diabetic subjects from the societal perspective was US$25,867, US$28,108 and US$26,177 for placebo, lifestyle modification and metformin intervention respectively. For diabetic patients, the total economic cost from the societal perspective was US$32,921, US$35,163 and US$33,232 for placebo, lifestyle modification and metformin intervention respectively. Lifestyle modification relative to placebo is likely to be associated with an incremental cost per QALY gained at US$36,663 while that of metformin intervention is likely to be US$6,367 from a societal perspective. Conclusion\: Based on adaptation of the DPP data to local conditions, both lifestyle modification and metformin intervention are likely to be cost-effective and worth implementing in Singapore to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. However, the cost of lifestyle modification from the societal perspective would have to be reduced in order to match the cost-effectiveness of metformin intervention.

description1116=Android befall iOS in popularity in Singapore, HK When it comes to Smartphones, It is clearly a battle between Android and iOS. But signs are emerging that Apple might be loosing grip in the two Asian markets. Conforming to Reuters report, most of the well-off smartphone users in Singapore and Hong Kong are turning to Android handsets, mostly Samsung, rather than iOS of Apple. The trouble that iPhone is their desire to be different that causing them as weakness and in turn an advantage to competing device. Reuters states that Appleâs share of mobile devices in SingaporeâiPad and iPhoneâfell from a peak of 72 percent in January 2012 to 50 percent this month. As for Android devices, they now account for 43 percent of the market, up from 20 percent in the same month last year. Hong Kong shows no different aftereffect, iOS devices declined from 45 percent to 30 percent in a year, while Android accounts for about two-thirds of smartphones used. These findings are not surprising at all, maybe not foreseen but definitely not shocking. We are used to long lines for the new iPhone but we are seeing longer lines for the Samsung Galaxy S III and Note II LTE in Singapore. With the support of our familiarity, we can safely claim that the interest in the apparent S4 will surely come as another hit in the market for the coming months. internet technology by abney and associates

description1114=This study attempted to compare the science laboratory learning environments of secondary schools across both developed and developing countries (Australia, Brunei, Cook Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, United States, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa). The study used a version of the Science Laboratory Learning Environment Inventory that had been previously validated for use in both developing and developed country contexts. Analysis of data generated found surprisingly similar science laboratory learning environments across most high schools throughout the countries with one of the environment scales, Open-endedness, as the least favorable scale. Overall students' attitude towards science were very favorable with boys tending to have a more favorable attitude than girls. The study suggests that global changes in general teaching practice has had little influence on science laboratory teaching practices and that science teaching, although to some extent culturally bound, also has to a large degree an "ethos" and methodology of its own, with an inherent resistance to change.

description1112=This article is from International Journal of Emergency Medicine , volume 5 . Abstract Background\: Emergency departments (EDs) are the basic units of emergency care. We performed a national inventory of all Singapore EDs and describe their characteristics and capabilities. Methods\: Singapore EDs accessible to the general public 24/7 were surveyed using the National ED Inventories instrument ( http\://www.emnet-nedi.org). ED staff members were asked about ED characteristics with reference to calendar year 2007. Results\: Fourteen EDs participated (100% response). All EDs were located in hospitals, and most (92%) were independent departments. One was a psychiatric ED; the rest were general EDs. Among general EDs, all had a contiguous layout, with medical and surgical care provided in one area. All but two EDs saw both adults and children; one ED was adult-only, and the other saw only children. Six were in the public sector and seven in private health-care institutions, with public EDs seeing the majority (78%) of ED patients. Each private ED had an annual patient census of 60,000. They received 98% of ambulances and had an inpatient admission rate of 30%. Two public EDs reported being overcapacity; no private EDs did. For both public and private EDs, availability of consultant resources in EDs was high, while technological resources varied. Conclusion\: Characteristics and capabilities of Singapore EDs varied and were largely dependent on whether they are in public or private hospitals. This initial inventory establishes a benchmark to further monitor the development of emergency care in Singapore.

description1105=This article is from Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism Case Reports , volume 2013 . Abstract Background\: Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by inappropriate insulin secretion in the face of severe hypoglycaemia. There are two histological subtypes of CHI namely diffuse and focal. Diffuse CHI is most common due to recessive mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 (which encode the SUR/KIR6.2 components of the pancreatic β-cell KATP channel) whereas focal CHI is due to a paternally inherited ABCC8/KCNJ11 mutation and somatic loss of heterozygosity for the 11p allele inside the focal lesion. Fluorine-18-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-DOPA-PET/CT) is used in the pre-operative localisation of focal lesions prior to surgery. Diffuse CHI if medically unresponsive will require a near total pancreatectomy whereas focal CHI will only require a limited lesionectomy, thus curing the patient from the hypoglycaemia.Aims\: To report the first case of genetically confirmed CHI in Singapore from a heterozygous paternally inherited ABCC8 mutation.Methods/Results\: A term male infant presented with severe hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH) after birth and failed medical treatment with diazoxide and octreotide. Genetic testing (paternally inherited mutation in ABCC8/p.D1472N) suggested focal disease, but due to the unavailability of 18F-DOPA-PET/CT to confirm focal disease, a partial pancreatectomy was performed. Interestingly, histology of the resected pancreatic tissue showed changes typical of diffuse disease.Conclusion\: Heterozygous paternally inherited ABCC8/KCNJ11 mutations can lead to diffuse or focal CHI.Learning points\: HH is a cause of severe hypoglycaemia in the newborn period.Paternal mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 can lead to diffuse or focal disease.18F-DOPA-PET/CT scan is the current imaging of choice for localising focal lesions.Gallium-68 tetra-aza-cyclododecane-NN′N″N-‴-tetra-acetate octreotate PET scan is not a useful imaging tool for localising focal lesions.The molecular mechanism by which a heterozygous ABCC8 mutation leads to diffuse disease is currently unclear.Focal lesions are curable by lesionectomy and so genetic studies in patients with HH must be followed by imaging using 18F-DOPA-PET/CT scan.
description1104=This article is from International Journal for Equity in Health , volume 11 . Abstract Objective\: To report the extent of self-reported chronic diseases, self-rated health status (SRH) and healthcare utilization among residents in 1-2 room Housing Development Board (HDB) apartments in Toa Payoh. Materials & methods\: The study population included a convenience sample of residents from 931 housing development board (HDB) units residing in 1-2 room apartments in Toa Payoh. Convenience sampling was used since logistics precluded random selection. Trained research assistants carried out the survey. Results were presented as descriptive summary. Results\: Respondents were significantly older, 48.3% reported having one or more chronic diseases, 32% have hypertension, 16.8% have diabetes, and 7.6% have asthma. Median SRH score was seven. Hospital inpatient utilization rate were highest among Indian ethnic group, unemployed, no income, high self-rated health (SRH) score, and respondents with COPD, renal failure and heart disease. Outpatient utilization rate was significantly higher among older respondents, females, and those with high SRH scores (7-10). Conclusions\: The findings confirming that residents living in 1-2 room HDB apartments are significantly older, with higher rates of chronic diseases, health care utilization than national average, will aid in healthcare planning to address their needs.

description1101=In order to identify the scope or limits of the practice of development journalism, a study examined the content of the Forum page in the "Straits Times" of Singapore during relatively free (1979-1980) and restricted (1986-1987) press periods. The study had two major objectives\: (1) to study the nature of the Forum page (a readers' letter page in which the government also participates); and (2) to observe if changes corresponding to the changes in press freedom were apparent on the Forum page. Altogether, the sample located 716 letters on the Forum page, and these were classified under 21 topics. Findings indicated that the change in press climate over the two periods did not bring about any major change on the Forum page; the guided press policy of Singapore manifested itself mainly, and possibly only, in the topics addressed, at least as far as the Forum page was concerned. (Seven tables of data, and 51 references are attached.) (NH)
description1100=Much of today's wealth and the creation of it require building or acquiring knowledge. If you want people to know what kind of product or service you sell, you need to take the time to tell them in order to increase their knowledge about you and your product. And the easiest and considered the most efficient and profitable way of doing that nowadays is through the Internet. Among the many human-invented tools available today, websites probably present the best opportunity to build the greatest amount of knowledge and wealth. People get educated through online activities such as podcasts, ebooks, online courses and video presentations. Even the most static homepage there is can provide basic information about something that could be essential to human health or in the arts. But a website on making wealth could take the cake for utilizing the potential of this technological tool to enhance a person or a company's wealth anywhere in the world. Whereas decades ago, learning to play the stocks took months or years and required enrolling in seminars or workshops and getting the actual experience where it happens, today anyone can have practice investing in the comfort of one's home. One can transfer money online and receive money in the same manner. For those who still believe this is a mere fantasy or a thing in the future, wake up and join the 21st Century\! Deep Blue Publications Group provides the most elementary knowledge in Madrid, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, and UK about shares, stocks and stock market investing. The process can be a bit daunting at first for those who have never considered investing in stocks seriously; but once you gain enough knowledge, your confidence increases as it usually happens for all of us. That is why Deep Blue Publications refers to it as BUILDING KNOWLEDGE. Whatever new information or insight one gains, your own appreciation of your abilities and potential heightens in proportion to newly-gained knowledge. Hence, BUILDING CONFIDENCE results from that first step. Taking the first step allows you to acquire the courage and ability to take the next few steps onward. The final result is BUILDING WEALTH. Knowledge itself is wealth. Once you begin the task of gaining new knowledge, you become a person who has increased in value – to yourself and to others. Persevering by going through the same process at higher and higher levels will ultimately bring in the desired monetary gains. Deep Blue Publications Group believes in this concept of creating wealth and so it takes sufficient time for the vital review of its publications online and how it can improve and develop the process in order to encourage more people to enter into the process of building wealth. Complaints and comments are welcomed by Deep Blue Publications Group as it pursues this objective on a long-term basis. One day at a time, that is. As difficult as stock market investing may seem to many people, there is a way to engaging it without losing one's pants or sanity. One can even, through the Internet, do virtual practice in investing without losing any cash and still get the essential experience one needs in the actual process of investing. The mind is the most powerful tool there is and aided by the information technology that is easily available to almost every person, practically nothing is beyond reach to most people. Unless one is convinced of the reality of one's potential to build wealth for oneself, one will remain in the realm of imagination and dreams and not in the real world of risk-taking and winning in the investment world.

description1098=This paper concerns the inclusion of information literacy and skills training in the undergraduate curriculum. Students were studied to determine their strengths and weaknesses in terms of their information literacy and skills. The methods used to study the students included a number of qualitative techniques applied while students conducted a research project. In general, it was found that students had limited skills in the area of information literacy. Major areas of difficulty include defining the problem, defining where to go for information, developing search strategies, finding material in the library, and developing insights and extrapolating. Based on these findings, recommendations were proposed to help develop information literacy and skills and incorporate their delivery in the university curriculum. The paper argues that incorporation in the curriculum is a necessity for their successful delivery. This is in contrast to treating these areas as a separate subject. In addition, the implications of these changes for faculty, staff, and librarians were defined. The initiative took place at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore and involved the NTU Library and the Division of Information Studies. (Contains 17 references.) (Author/MES)

description1090=What is Art? The question has often been asked by many people. And the answer can be as many as the people who can give an answer. For the art collector, the answer is quite obvious\: that which you can buy at an art gallery. And that answer can have a logic that many will learn to appreciate. Firstly, galleries have the artistic, technical and economic capabilities to know or define what good art is --- not just art but that which is above the rest, if not at the very top of all the rest. But not many people can afford highly-expensive works, or even reasonably priced ones. If one can buy and treasure a couple of art works for the rest of one’s life, it would be enough. But a few dream of collecting more -- and even making some money out of doing so. Hawkfield Gallery fine arts consultants have the broad experience of buying and selling art and in the process have gained the expertise to help other start their own collection or enhance what they already have. Very much like children collecting cards, art collecting is a passion that is shared by those who love art and wish to expand appreciation for great art works.   Beyond appreciating art as a whole, Hawfield Gallery art consultants have the goal of enhancing appreciation for folk art and preserving American culture and history contained in those art works. Art, to be honest, is a living legacy which expands the mind and the soul of those who have insight into art’s power to enlighten us of the greatness and goodness of life of whatever era in American history it might portray. Although some art subject matters may exhibit the pains and struggles of ancestors, they still highlight the positive virtues that have made their country what it is today, a leader among leaders in the world.  The Hawkfield Gallery is located on a picturesque scenic route in a shore town halfway between Boston and Cape Cod, itself a witness to the colorful history of the nation. It is housed in an 1850's farmhouse and exactly where there used to be a tearoom, craft shop and lending library in the 1920's. The farmhouse is located in an area beside the historic North River and was once operated as a dairy farm up to the 1960’s. Visitors can take a leisurely a walk along bucolic woodland trails which lead to a pier on the river. Or they can go beyond to one of the numerous antique shops, galleries or historic sites in the South Shore's Plymouth County. Now you know how rich the place is when it comes to American pioneer history. Owning one art work bought from Hawkfield Gallery is, in essence, a tribute to the continuing allegiance that Americans have for their rich national heritage. And buying one right at their gallery right can certainly add a little more fervor to that burning flame in every patriotic American citizen. Nevertheless, you need not be an American to feel like one and to appreciate or own American folk art. You just need to be a lover of art.

description1087=Keeley Consulting Group nylig gjennomført noen vurderinger om politikkutvikling. Det viser seg at en organisasjon skal konstruere en klart definert og nøye skrevet politikk for å sikre en hyggelig, oppmuntrende, organisert, trygg og upartiske arbeidsplass. I utgangspunktet, mange av oss liker ikke en inkonsekvent og inkonsekvent brukt politikk . De føre ofte til mer problemer oppå ble utformet for å løse. Men er politikk en viktig del av enhver organisasjon. De definerer nødvendig retningslinjene for selskaper å drive skikkelig og påvirke oppførselen til individer til et bestemt resultat. Vurder følgende tips gitt av Keeley Consulting Group på hvordan å utvikle ny politikk for organisasjonen. Først, se til at det finnes en policy om politikk. Vi vet at det høres litt overflødig, men det er nødvendig å arbeide i et forhåndsdefinert og besluttet rammeverk selv om det gjelder politikk. Sannsynligvis er det første og viktigste trinnet i modning politikk å gjøre en enkel policy på policyer som klargjør organisasjonens prosessen for å opprette nye policyer. Denne policyen bør bestå av veiledning om hva situasjoner utgjør behovet for en ny politikk, formatet som nye retningslinjer bør bruke, samt prosessen som må følges for en ny policy godkjennes. Det er en stor mulighet at du har en stor inkonsekvens i resultatene og inkonsekvens i etableringen hvis du ikke har en prosess og ramme rundt politikkutforming. Dette kan også resultere i dårlig eller vanskelig håndheving. Andre identifisere eventuelle overlapp med eksisterende policyer. Du må sjekke grundig hvis policyen du planlegger å opprette allerede finnes, eller det deler av den finnes i andre retningslinjer før du oppretter en ny policy. Hvis det er tilfelle, kan du vurdere å endre eksisterende policyer i stedet for å opprette en ny. Tredje ikke Opprett policyen i et vakuum. Keeley Consulting Group antyder at politikk bør utvikles med innspill fra de som påvirkes av dem heller enn sitter bak pulten og gjøre politikken som du følte var nødvendig og som ble utviklet helt på egenhånd. Det er viktig at alle interessenter bli hørt for å redusere muligheten for utilsiktede konsekvenser, selv om den endelige politikken til slutt ikke gjenspeiler alle meninger. Retningslinjer må absolutt være fullført og ekstra meninger kan bidra til å lukke hull som kan eksistere. Fjerde gå tilbake og tenke på behovet. Husk at du bør opprette policyer når det er et klart behov og en løs problemet for å løse, ikke bare fordi noen gjorde noe du ikke liker. Ifølge Keeley Consulting Group gjennomgang, enkelte policyer ble satt på plass av trass og hevn, og denne typen aktivitet skje ikke i en fornuftig organisasjon. Det vil også skje i et firma som har en streng politikk på politikk, som policyen vil ofte gå gjennom flere nivåer for godkjenning. Femte, gjøre bruk av de riktige ordene så det blir ingen misforståelser. Sørg for at du vil bruke enkel og bestemt terminologi fordi politikk bør lett forstås å være effektive. Vi angitt nedenfor noen viktige tips\: -Bruke ordene “må” eller “vil” i stedet for bør”” i kroppen av policyen. Hvis noe er valgfritt, bruke ordet “bør”, men ikke når det er et krav. -Bruk en avdeling, office, enhet, eller jobbtittel stedet navnet på en person. -Kontakt e-post må være en generell avdeling-adresse eller en web-side som gir ytterligere kontaktinformasjon. Vennligst unngå bruk av en individuell e-postadresse for å unngå policyen fra trenger oppdateringer når personellendringer skjer. -Ikke understreke deloverskrifter eller ord som skal være understreket i en setning. Sett i stedet deloverskrifter fet eller kursiv hvis et ord har understrekes. Hvis policyen posteres online, kan understrekede ord forveksles med hyperkoblinger. Sjette ta et unntak prosess når det er mulig. I de fleste tilfeller er det et unntak for hver regel. Det er mye lettere å identifisere hvordan et unntak prosessen er å operere på forhånd før policyen er implementert. Vær oppmerksom på at unntak må gis på en måte som er rettferdig og rimelig. Hele politikken kan kalles inn spørsmålet hvis du var uforsiktig med unntak prosessen. Syvende, la noen gråtoner. Keeley Consulting Group mener at noen retningslinjer å forlate litt uskarpt å lage avgjørelser. Det er greit hvis politikk forlater litt grå slik at en person kan gjøre en on-the-fly beslutning. Åttende, definere politikk vedlikehold ansvar. De fleste retningslinjer krever regelmessig gjennomgang å sikre deres fortsatte anvendelighet. Sørg for at du alltid identifisere kontoret som er ansvarlig for policyen fordi noen trenger å kunne gi oppklarende informasjon når spørsmål reist om policyen. Identifiser ikke enkeltpersoner siden de kommer og går. Til slutt, konfigurere policyen bibliotek med versjonskontroll. I dag finnes det flere verktøy som lar deg lagre forskjellige versjoner av dokumenter. Alle ansatte som skal tilgang alle aktuelle policyer hele tiden. Versjonskontroll kan også hjelpe enkeltpersoner å se historien av policyen til å spore hva som er endret gjennom årene.

description1083=Forty students in the Executive MBA (Master of Business Administration) program at Xavier University (Cincinnati, Ohio) completed a required overseas study tour, with approximately half visiting Japan and Singapore and half visiting England, Belgium, and Germany. The purpose of the tour was to explore and assess innovative business strategies, international business strategies, the role of quality, and cultural adaptation in the business environment in Asia and Europe. Instructional components included presentations by prominent business and government leaders, 5-hour visits to companies in small groups, and cultural tours. This paper presents findings on participants' attitudes based on pre-tour and post-tour survey data. Results indicated that\: (1) the largest changes in participants' attitudes occurred for those statements relating to participants'"comfort" levels; (2) in all cases, participants felt more comfortable after the overseas study tour; (3) after the tour, participants responded that it is less difficult to enter a foreign market than they had felt prior to the tour; and (4) the tour increased the awareness of management practices and negotiating similarities around the world. The paper concludes that overseas study tours should become an increasingly important component of Executive MBA programs everywhere. (JDD)

description1080=Open education resources (OER) may be defined as any digital materials designed for use in teaching and learning that are openly available for use by educators and students, without an accompanying need to pay royalties or license fees. Hitherto, research on students' use of OER has been mainly limited to those in Western countries, mainly in the USA. Research on other students' use of OER such as those from Asian Pacific countries has been lacking. In this study, we attempt to fill this gap by exploring a class of Asian undergraduates' views about the use and production of OER. A total of 25 students who were enrolled in an education course at a university in Singapore completed a questionnaire. Results showed that half the respondents used OER to either quite or a great extent. The most common type of OER used was Youtube followed by iTunes (e.g., iTunes U). Respondents attributed more weightage to the reputation of an institution or organization rather than the individual creator with regard to the production of OER. Results also suggested that respondents were generally OER "lurkers"--individuals who tend to take free open education content for their own use but are not willing to produce these resources for others to use. The most significant barriers to producing OER were "lack of skills", followed by "lack of subject knowledge". The least significant barrier reported by the respondents was "lack of interest".

description1079=A common concern raised by teachers from secondary schools and junior colleges in Singapore is the apparent inability or reluctance of adolescents to think critically and originally. Adolescent thought processes are probably shaped by the change in intellectual pace and quality between the primary and secondary school curriculum. This study of adolescent thinking considers the last two Piagetian states of cognitive development and the transition from concrete operations to formal operations, focussing on the adolescents' ability to make judgements and the extent to which adolescent judgement is guided by possibilities other than those given. A sample of 800 adolescents from 13 to 16 years of age was drawn from 6 schools. Subjects were asked to respond to the Test of Judgmental Ability, an anecdotal measure. The cross-sectional study revealed developmental differences in performances between adolescent males and females in favor of males, particularly at higher levels of judgement. Various analyses showed that age is the dominant factor accounting for differences in judgmental level, with academic achievement and home environment as contributing factors. Results suggest a transition period between the two forms of thinking. (WP)

Abstract Background\: Asthma genetics has been extensively studied and many genes have been associated with the development or severity of this disease. In contrast, the genetic basis of allergic rhinitis (AR) has not been evaluated as extensively. It is well known that asthma is closely related with AR since a large proportion of individuals with asthma also present symptoms of AR, and patients with AR have a 5–6 fold increased risk of developing asthma. Thus, the relevance of asthma candidate genes as predisposing factors for AR is worth investigating. The present study was designed to investigate if SNPs in highly replicated asthma genes are associated with the occurrence of AR. Methods\: A total of 192 SNPs from 21 asthma candidate genes reported to be associated with asthma in 6 or more unrelated studies were genotyped in a Swedish population with 246 AR patients and 431 controls. Genotypes for 429 SNPs from the same set of genes were also extracted from a Singapore Chinese genome-wide dataset which consisted of 456 AR cases and 486 controls. All SNPs were subsequently analyzed for association with AR and their influence on allergic sensitization to common allergens. Results\: A limited number of potential associations were observed and the overall pattern of P-values corresponds well to the expectations in the absence of an effect. However, in the tests of allele effects in the Chinese population the number of significant P-values exceeds the expectations. The strongest signals were found for SNPs in NPSR1 and CTLA4. In these genes, a total of nine SNPs showed P-values

description1077=This text explains the importance of interfaith harmony as well as the shared roots of all religions. Also, Please read Ven Master Chin Kung's Speech on the subject as well\: One Humanity, Many Faiths Venerable Master Chin Kung AM An Interfaith Summit for Peace and Harmony in Australia and the Asia-Pacific Region 18-21, February 2009 Distinguished faith elders, scholars, and guests\: Hello, everyone\! It is quite rare that I have this opportunity to listen to your valuable opinions. I am truly grateful. Australia is a country where many cultures, many ethnic groups, and many faiths intermingle. This country pays particular attention to the human spirit of equality, harmony, mutual respect, and mutual help. The reality is that, because of ease of travel, advanced technology, and availability of information, the whole world has become a village, and we are now in an era of the intermingling of religions, of ethnic groups, and of cultures. I deeply believe that determining how to strengthen interfaith communication and cooperation, and to achieve the ideal of social and world harmony is an important issue that everyone present is concerned about. Unearthing the Root of Conflict After the September 11 attacks, the Australian Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Queensland invited me to participate in a symposium at the university attended by professors from the centre. During the panel, I presented my view, explaining that the true root of conflict is the conflict between our true nature and our acquired habits within us. The true nature is of the utmost purity and virtuousness. It is perfect and radiant. Habits are the bad thoughts and views that one acquired after birth. Simply put, the conflict between the true nature and acquired habits is the conflict between altruism and self-benefit. Compassion, loving-kindness, and all virtues are innate in the true nature of all beings, but selfishness and all bad thoughts are not. Therefore, if those who engage in the teaching of peace can (1) truly resolve in their minds their conflicts with anyone, any matter, and any thing, (2) let go of all selfish thoughts and actions of controlling and possessing, and (3) interact with others and engage in tasks with sincere love, then this would truly be the basic way to resolve all contradictions and conflicts in the world. A harmonious world must begin with our minds. Modern science has gradually come to prove this fact. Dr. Masaru Emoto of Japan has conducted water experiments for more than a decade and found that water can understand human thoughts, react naturally to them and thus change accordingly. When water was introduced to thoughts of love and gratitude, it displayed beautiful crystals. When the same water was bombarded with thoughts of hatred and disgust, it displayed broken, ugly crystals. Dr. Emoto once said with deep feeling, “In hundreds of thousands of experiments, the most beautiful water crystals are elicited by the thoughts of love and gratitude. ‘Love’ and ‘gratitude’ seem to be the core of the universe.” I deeply agree with this view. Consider this\: water, which is only a mineral, can react this way. So, if human beings, who have the highest spiritual awareness of all creatures, can communicate with one another with sincere love, there is no reason that conflict and contradiction can not be resolved. In October 2005, I met with Elder Mahathir, the former Prime Minister of Malaysia. The elder asked if there would ever be any peace in the world. I have humbly learned the teachings of the Buddha and the sages for fifty-eight years and dare not slack off for even one day. I believe the ancient teachings and affirm that human nature is originally good. Therefore, I sincerely proposed that if every country, every ethnic group, every political party and faction, and every religious group can broaden their minds and horizons, treat one another equally, get along with them harmoniously, seek common ground and put aside differences, and exist and flourish side by side, then an ideal harmonious society and world will definitely be realized. It is difficult to achieve this, but if we start with achieving religious cooperation, it will have a positive impact on the cooperation of countries, of ethnic groups, and of political parties. Elder Mahathir readily agreed with this proposal. The next day, he invited me to attend the Perdana Global Peace Forum to be held in Kuala Lumpur under his sponsorship in December 2005. Why Can Religious Cooperation Resolve Conflict? In 1998, I was living in Singapore. At that time, there were nine major religious groups there. I interacted with them with sincerity and we became good friends. Later on, I also had wonderful opportunities to interact and seek advice from religious elders in countries such as Japan, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, and Australia. I learned tremendously from them. I deeply feel that all religious sages used the intrinsic essences of “compassion, loving-kindness, sincerity, respectfulness, humility, and harmony” to teach all beings to end wrongdoings and practice virtuous conduct, to break through delusion and attain enlightenment, and to get along harmoniously with one another and treat one another equally. Their teachings encompass the teachings of morality, virtues, the law of cause and effect, philosophy, and science. For example, Hinduism teaches “No harming, no stealing, chastity, kindness, impartiality, patience, perseverance, a moderate diet, and cleanliness. These are the ten precepts.” Zoroastrianism teaches “Consider them as thine own, and this is thy religion.” Catholicism teaches “You love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.” Christianity teaches “Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.” Confucianism teaches “Human beings, regardless of nationality, race, or religions, everyone should be loved equally. We are all sheltered by the same sky and we all live on the same planet Earth.” Islam teaches “There is only one moral norm, which is the principle of universal love originating from selfless and virtuous deeds.” Taoism teaches “Be loyal to one’s superior, be filial to one’s parents, respect one’s brothers, and be a trustworthy friend.” Sikhism teaches “More than all else do I cherish at heart that love which makes me to live a limitless life in this world.” Bahaism teaches “The purpose of the one true God in manifesting Himself is to summon all mankind to truthfulness and sincerity, to piety and trustworthiness,…” and “The peoples of the world, of whatever race or religion, derive their inspiration from one heavenly Source, and are the subjects of one God.” Buddhism says “Be filial and provide for parents, and be respectful to and serve teachers,” “Do nothing that is bad; do everything that is good,” “Be greatly compassionate. People will abide by morality. The land and people will be enveloped in peace.” Therefore, we know\: Love is the true mind, the true nature, truly what it is (suchness), and Dharma nature. Love is the original nature, the innate goodness, the utmost purity, and the utmost virtuousness. Love is the truth, true meaning, life, and eternity. Love is holiness, God, Allah, and the holy spirit. Love nurtures everything in the universe. Everything in the universe is born and grows from love. Love is the root of all virtues, all abilities, and all good fortune. From this we can deeply believe that if the religious groups whose teachings are based on sincere love can truly work together and propagate their teachings extensively, they will definitely be able to help all beings uncover their innate goodness and resolve all contradictions and conflicts. All Religions Are One Family Although the texts of each religion give different descriptions of the origin of life and the universe, my religious friends all affirm that the one and only True God has perfect wisdom and extraordinary powers and his teaching varies according to the geographical environment, lifestyle, culture, education, and the needs of each ethnic group. In China, he manifested as Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, and Zhuangzi. In Buddhism, he manifested as Sakyamuni Buddha. In Christianity, he manifested as Jesus, in Judaism, as Moses, and in Islam, as Muhammad. Buddhism teaches that everything is one entity; everything is “manifested by the true mind and altered by the consciousness.” The true mind is actually another name for Allah and God. The same True God has various manifestation bodies, which are ultimately the same. Their common goal is to help all beings end wrongdoings and practice virtuous conduct, and break through delusion and attain enlightenment. The concept of holomovement proposed by modern scientist David Bohm is a great inspiration to us. The core of this concept is that the universe is an undivided wholeness. The whole has closely interconnected parts. Any one of the parts carries the information of the whole. In other words, the whole is included in every one of the parts. All the religions are like the different departments of a university. The chancellor is the one and only True God. The professors of each department are the manifestation bodies of the True God. From this concept, we can deeply appreciate that all of the different religions in the world are one family. We should completely let go of arrogance, jealousy, and greed, treat one another equally, get along with everyone harmoniously, and work together to help people awaken. Suffering arises from delusion. Happiness arises from awakening. Only when we are truly awakened will we naturally leave suffering behind and attain happiness. Traveling Will Enhance Communication When I was living in Singapore, I invited the nine representatives from the Inter-religious Organization of Singapore (IRO) to come to our lecture hall to teach and to have dialogs with the Buddhist practitioners. I also visited them and lectured at their invitation. We learned from one another. During the millennium dinner party, the representatives of the IRO sincerely prayed together for world peace. In addition, a group was formed to visit China in 2000. In 2003, when the Pure Land Learning College held its grand opening, the IRO came and conveyed their best wishes. During the trips, all the religious representatives shared ideas and truly communicated, and thus became close friends. In July 2004, an Indonesian interfaith delegation visited Cairo, Egypt and the Vatican. On that trip they met with the elders at Al Azhar University, an Islamic university that has a history of over one thousand years, and then Pope John Paul II. In December of the same year, an Indonesian interfaith delegation, led by the former president of Indonesia, Mr. Abdurrahman Wahid, visited Chinese religious representatives. As the proverb says\: “Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles.” Being invited on these trips as advisor, I, too, benefited a great deal in the harmonious atmosphere of such various interfaith visits. In October 2006, at the invitation of Dr. Preeyanuch Jariyavidyanont, Deputy Permanent Delegate of Thailand to UNESCO, the Pure Land Learning College co-hosted the three-day “Celebration of the 2550th Birth Anniversary of the Buddha” with UNESCO at its Paris headquarters. We sincerely invited representatives of the religions from Singapore and Australia to pray together for world peace on stage. With the lectures and an exhibition, we successfully proved three things to the delegates from the 192 countries in UNESCO and participants from all over the world. Religious groups can indeed work together. There is only one True God in the universe. This True God is love. One can indeed be taught to be a better person. In the township of Tangchi, Lujiang, China, the teachers at The Lujiang Centre of Cultural Education practiced and taught the Confucian Guidelines for Being a Good Person. These actions deeply moved the local residents. Within three months, good social values were restored significantly, which serves as proof [that one can indeed be taught to be a better person]. From this we can see that the teaching of traditional culture of the sages around the world can truly be applied to resolve contradiction and conflict and achieve world peace today. In May 2008, I was invited to join a Malaysian religious delegation visiting Islamic groups in Xinjiang Province, China. We visited the Islamic Institute and amiably exchanged views with local Muslims. It was a rare opportunity in learning. The aforementioned trips and visits greatly enhanced interfaith learning, communication, and understanding, and these generated very good results. Generally, religious leaders have limited contact with one another. Even when they meet occasionally, their time together is short. If they can travel together, they will be in one another’s company from morning till night and the best communication in every aspect will be achieved. Delving Deeply into Religious Teaching For religious groups to get along harmoniously and to understand and help one another, the most important foundation is to understand the core teachings of every religion and to practice them. Therefore, it is indeed necessary for religious groups to learn one another’s religious texts. In Chinese etymology, religion, or zongjiao, has profound meanings. Zong conveys the meaning of “fundamental,” “main,” and “revere.” Jiao is “education.” Therefore, zongjiao means “a fundamental, main education; a teaching that is worth respecting and praising.” Once an Indonesian practitioner asked me, “How can different religious groups get along harmoniously without conflict?” I answered that the most important thing is to diligently learn one’s own religious teaching. For example, Indonesia acknowledges five religions\: Islam, Catholicism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism. These five religions are like a person’s five fingers. They differ in length, but when one traces them back to the palm, the wrist, and the arm, one will know that the fingers share the same root and the same origin. Therefore, as long as one continues to delve deeply into one’s religious texts, when one gets to a certain level, one will naturally comprehend the teaching. When one is exposed to the texts of other religions, one will also be able to understand them. An ancient saying speaks of “delving deeply into one teaching and immersing oneself in it for a long time.” When one delves deeply and reaches a certain level, one will attain a pure mind and will naturally have a thorough understanding. I feel that when different religious groups begin to interact with one another, they should seek common ground and put aside differences. They should especially point out the common teachings in the texts and put aside the teachings that are different. The teachings of the sages come from great minds, and great minds think alike. We see differences because our level of cultivation is not deep enough. If we continue to learn and delve deeply into our own teachings and elevate our level, we will naturally understand and all the differences will dissolve. A proverb says\: “Everyone shares the same heart. Since they share the same heart, they would think in a similar fashion.” Different religious groups will naturally be like brothers and sisters, respecting, loving, and working with one another. For years, I have diligently learned various religious texts such as the Old and New Testaments and the Qur’an. When I study the Bible, I become a devout Christian or a devout Catholic. When I study the Qur’an, I become a devout Muslim. My sincerity and respect for Allah and God are pure and impartial, just like my sincerity and respect for Buddhas and bodhisattvas. I deeply understand that only when I completely put down the three obstacles of jealousy, anger, and greed and affirm that all sages are my best teachers will I benefit from studying the texts and really understand the true meanings of the sages’ teachings. Taking up the Mission of Propagating the Proper Teachings Today, the world is in chaos. The root reason is that Easterners neglect the teaching of the sages and Westerners neglect religious education. Take traditional Chinese teaching for example. The two most important subjects for children are the classics and history. Chinese classics are the basis of the teaching of the sages. History books are the accumulation of previous generations’ experiences. If one does not study the classics, one will not grow in learning and virtue. If one does not study history, one will not be enriched in knowledge and experience. People today neglect the classics and history and abandon religion. They do not know that religious teaching and the teaching of the sages are about natural law. Or that truth, virtuousness, beauty, and wisdom are innate in the minds and nature of all beings. Therefore, they are at a loss; they do not know what to do. From individuals and families to society, countries, and even nature and the universe, enormous conflict arises and cannot be resolved. At this critical moment, propagators of each religion, without a doubt, should take up the great mission of “reviving and passing on the teachings of the ancient sages and achieving everlasting peace for future generations” and fulfill the sacred aspiration of propagating and protecting the proper teachings and saving the world from pending disasters. When we carefully look at history, it is easy for us to see that the teaching of every religion in the world is a perfect multicultural social teaching of the utmost virtuousness. The founders of all the religions were voluntary multicultural social educators. Jesus taught for three years. Muhammad taught for twenty-seven years. Confucius taught for five years. Sakyamuni Buddha taught for forty-nine years. They all completely let go of prestige, wealth, and greed. They were pure in mind and body. They engaged in cultivation and taught people from all walks of life, without discrimination. Therefore, they were able to exert profound and wide-reaching influence on people of their times and later generations. I sincerely hope that the United Nations or the government of each country will establish a university of religions to nurture good teachers of religions, who will delve deeply into their own religious teachings and learn from one another. The students will give lectures every day. After being assessed by a governmental review board as to whether it is truly beneficial to social stability and harmony, approved lectures can be broadcasted to people on national television and around the world via the Internet and satellite television for long-distance learning. Important religious maxims can be extracted and compiled into books to enhance interfaith communication and understanding, truly affirming “One Humanity, Many Faiths.” Indeed, all of the cultures, all ethnic groups, and all learning are one entity. This way, all the contradictions and conflicts will naturally be resolved. We can gladly expect a harmonious world. All beings will be happy. I hope that everyone present today will share this great wish and have the same mind and the same aspiration. I sincerely hope that everyone here will courteously invite the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Kevin Rudd to be the first one to establish a global university of religions or a global multicultural university, so that Australia will lead the world to peace and stability and set the best example for other countries. This will be the true contribution that everyone present today makes to their countries and people and to the humanity. In conclusion, I wish the summit every success\! And I wish all of you good health\! May the propagation of your teachings be truly successful\! I also wish Prime Minister, Mr. Kevin Rudd good health. May Australia continue to enjoy every prosperity.

description1066=Most of the United States population has been using credit cards . It is rare to find anyone who does not have credit card nowadays. Other developing countries are also adapting this trend and have started carrying cards for purchase, paying debts or doing monetary transactions. Credit card terminals are rampantly spreading even in convenience stores and buses cross the globe.  Singapore, Japan and Seoul, South Korea are some of the biggest markets of credit card because of their outstanding financial capabilities. Surprisingly, cities of developing nations are also competing for the most used credit cards. According to reviews , Jakarta, Indonesia and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia are included to the top ten places in South East Asia to have an ample amount of purchases using credit cards.  With the trend continuously growing, Axis Capital Business Funding, a company which provides credit loans to small business owners across the globe has released their top reasons why credit card is slowly replacing cash\: 1. Helps in Budgeting For simple homemakers or frugal individuals who keep track of their expenses, credit card can help organize their finances. You can monitor your purchases and financial transactions and also ask for monthly balance through the receipts. 2. Helps in Credit History Credit scores and reports are vital when you would have to loan one day. Your credit history which shows if you have spent and surpassed your credit limit and the frequency of using your credit card can help boost your credit score. It can also build a solid credit history which can tell lenders that you can be trusted. 3. Helps in Saving Money When you pay your debts on time, it can boost your credit score. When you have a good credit score, you can have a discount in mortgages, lower interest rate, car purchases etcetera 4. Helps in Availing Rewards When you are using your credit card often, it can gain you rewards and freebies. There can be points or other promotions that your credit card provider may be teaming up with, perhaps a free round-trip ticket or free items when you purchase. Just make sure you don’t give your confidential information for the redemption of your rewards. It can also be a scam used to lure you in. 5. Helps you Purchase Fast Credit cards are now accepted everywhere compared to cash that you have to exchange with local currency if you are traveling abroad. Moreover, if you are fond of purchasing online, having a credit card can also keep your transaction hassle free.

description1060=This paper presents four questionnaire surveys administered in educational research. Each of the questionnaires is followed by a brief research report with an abstract and summary statistics. The first survey, "Guam Undergraduate Women Questionnaire," explores the status aspiration and gender awareness of undergraduate women in Guam. Responses of 11 women provide a profile of female undergraduates, but do not show significant differences between Chamorro (Guam ethnic group) and non-Chamorro women. The second questionnaire, the "Computer-Assisted Instruction Questionnaire," was developed in 1995 to identify and prioritize the factors influencing a university faculty's use of computer-assisted instruction in Singapore. Responses of 62 faculty members show the inhibitors and facilitators of using computer assisted instruction. The third questionnaire, the "Diversity and Multiculturalism Questionnaire," was developed in 1999 to determine the attitudes of the faculty of the University of Guam toward multicultural education, with a focus on diversity, ethnicity, and pluralism. Responses from 104 faculty members showed no significant differences among teachers of various ethnic groups toward multicultural education. The final questionnaire, the "Multicultural Education Questionnaire," was developed in 2000 to analyze the theory and practice of multiculturalism in higher education in Guam, focusing on faculty strategies in incorporating multicultural pedagogic strategies at an American Pacific island university. Sixty-five faculty members responded, with most expressing support for and interest in multicultural education. (SLD)

description1053=This article is from Chinese Journal of Cancer , volume 30 . Abstract Unusual sites of metastases are recognized in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, the prognostic implications of these sites are not well understood. We used the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk classification for metastatic RCC to evaluate 912 consecutive patients with RCC managed at the Singapore General Hospital between 1990 and 2009. Among these patients, 301 had metastases either at diagnosis or during the course of illness. Nasal metastases, all arising from clear cell RCC, were identified histologically in 4 patients (1.3% of those with metastasis). All 4 patients were classified as MSKCC poor prognosis by current risk criteria. Nasal metastases were significantly associated with lung and bone metastases. The frequency of nasal metastases in patients with metastatic RCC is about 1 %, occurring predominantly in patients with clear cell RCC. Nasal metastases are associated with poor prognosis as estimated by the MSKCC risk classification, with attendant implications for selection of targeted therapy, and are usually associated with multi -organ dissemination, including concurrent lung and bone involvement.

description1049=This report is a collaborative research effort between the New Media Consortium (NMC), Concordia International School Shanghai, and NIST International School in Bangkok, Thailand, to help inform international school leaders in Asia about significant developments in technologies supporting teaching, learning, and creative inquiry in primary and secondary education. The research underpinning the report makes use of the NMC's Delphi-based process for bringing groups of experts to a consensus viewpoint, in this case around the impact of emerging technologies on teaching, learning, and creative inquiry in international schools in Asia (ISA) over the next five years. This document was produced to explore emerging technologies and forecast their potential impact expressly in a primary and secondary education context. In the effort that took place from May through July 2014, a carefully selected panel of experts was asked to consider hundreds of relevant articles, news, blog posts, research, and project examples as part of the preparation that ultimately pinpointed the most notable emerging technology topics, trends, and challenges for international schools in Asia over the next five years. Known as the 2014 Horizon Project ISA Expert Panel, that group of thought leaders consists of distinguished individuals, all highly regarded in their fields. Collectively the panel represents a range of diverse perspectives across the education sector for international schools in Asia. The Expert Panel presents 12 "technologies to watch," and agreed that instilling a school and work/life balance is imperative as technology rapidly evolves and becomes more accessible. The key sections of the report, in general, constitute a reference and straightforward technology-planning guide for educators, researchers, administrators, policy makers, and technologists. It is the hope of the Expert Panel that this research will help to inform the choices that institutions are making about technology to improve, support, or extend teaching, learning, and creative inquiry in international schools in Asia. [Additional support for the production of this report was provided by 21 Century Learning, Canadian International School of Hong Kong, Eduro Learning, Innovative Professional Development, Nanjing International School, Renaissance College Hong Kong, Singapore American School, United World College of South East Asia, and Yokohama International School.]

description1048=Den amerikanske Kongressen har implementert et mandat angaende revisjon av forsikringspremier, som resulterer i ekstra byrde for bolig under National flom forsikring Program. Programmet tilsynelatende har USD 24 milliarder i gjeld og kunne ikke lenger folge med kontingent pa grunn av subsidier i bonuser og utgifter pa orkaner Sandy og Katrina . Forsikring priser er na ventes a oke med om lag 10% per ar mens overpris spenner fra USD 25-250 er ogsa beregnet. Og for mange Broadkill bolig, de avbrytes effektivt ut noen fordel fra stranden renourishment prosjekt. Medlem av den statlige radgivende komiteen som driver havet stiger studier innrommet at stranden utvide pa Broadkill selvfolgelig gjor det mer behagelig, men ikke til huseiere som er ute til betydelig hoyere flom forsikring priser. Dessverre kom dette i en tid nar den foderale regjeringen er utfasing av flom forsikring subsidier for nesten en million amerikanere som bor i lavland samfunn. I henhold til regjeringen Ansvarlighet Office har forsikring programmet bare tilstrekkelige midler til a betale gjeld renter. En losning pa lavere forsikring priser vil vaere a gjore masse oppussing pa samfunnets strukturer for a sette dem pa hoyere hoyde. Gjor slike oppgraderinger standarden i en kystomradet vil redusere sannsynligheten for dem a bli skadet av oversvommelser. Tre ar etter Superstorm sandstranden rammet omradet, fant en studie av Army Corps of Engineers ut at omradene som overlevd angrep har en felles faktor--sanddyner og brede strender. Dette i sin tur forte mange til a opprette beskyttende sanddyner og utvide utarmet strender. Men tjenestemenn fra Delaware og FEMA (Federal sosialtjenestene) har vaert oppfordret regjeringen til a revurdere ideen om at renourished strender kan redusere potensialet i storm og oversvommelse. De hevdet at slike menneskeskapt strender er likevel sannsynlig a vaske bort lett. Keeley Consulting Group ytterligere observert at andre kystomradene er gradvis grotting i like pa grunn av den naturlige geologiske prosessen kalles innsynkning. Angivelig, dumping mer sand for a utvide strendene er ikke til a kutte den uunngaelige okningen av flom forsikringspremier. En manager fra Department of Natural Resources og miljokontroll bemerket at slikt prosjekt som Broadkill er bare en midlertidig losning som det er ingen sikkerhet som en storre strand vil virkelig siste.

description1045=The Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) of Singapore commissioned a review of its curriculum development process in order to identify ways that the process can be made more effective and efficient for trainees. The methodology included briefings, site visits, interviews, and review of curriculum documents. The following strengths of the process were found\: high quality curriculum products; dedicated, skilled staff; use of new curriculum processes; state-of-the-art training facilities; industry involvement; and excellent public reputation of the VITB. Areas of concern were also raised\: greater focus on content than competencies; lack of flexibility; need for quicker response to technological change; fragmentation of the curriculum development process; need for different types of instructional materials; and lack of encouragement for innovation and experimentation. Short-term, mid-term, and long-term recommendations were made that would accomplish the following\: adjust programs to meet the needs of trainees; shorten new program development and course review time; increase knowledge of current skills required by jobs; respond to technological change; reduce process frustration; incorporate new and revised curriculum; and personalize and individualize trainee needs. (Twelve appendices present the following\: model for training design and evaluation; organizational structure and major functions of the curriculum development division; VITB curriculum documents; approval of curriculum; consultancy program; list of persons contacted; elements of competency-based education; proposed curriculum model; Systematic Curriculum and Instructional Development systems approach summary; task analysis; task analysis form; and competency-based education and training background paper.)

description1039=SparksLab Global Venture - According to a post on Andela’s blog, the developer talent accelerator has received more than 10,000 applications in six months. Andela launched six months ago, in September 2014, and has been gaining traction. “Today, we crossed an important milestone” said Jeremy Johnson in the blog post. “Andela has now received over 10,000 applications. The size of our applicant pool is a testament to the fact that word about what we are doing has spread across Nigeria — and beyond. Applications have been received from South Africa, Botswana, Ghana and Kenya, a signal that there is demand for Andela in other parts of the continent.”

description1029=This article is from PLoS ONE , volume 9 . Abstract Two independent studies by two separate research teams (from Hong Kong and Singapore) failed to detect any influenza RNA landing on, or inhaled by, a life-like, human manikin target, after exposure to naturally influenza-infected volunteers. For the Hong Kong experiments, 9 influenza-infected volunteers were recruited to breathe, talk/count and cough, from 0.1 m and 0.5 m distance, onto a mouth-breathing manikin. Aerosolised droplets exhaled from the volunteers and entering the manikin’s mouth were collected with PTFE filters and an aerosol sampler, in separate experiments. Virus detection was performed using an in-house influenza RNA reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. No influenza RNA was detected from any of the PTFE filters or air samples. For the Singapore experiments, 6 influenza-infected volunteers were asked to breathe (nasal/mouth breathing), talk (counting in English/second language), cough (from 1 m/0.1 m away) and laugh, onto a thermal, breathing manikin. The manikin’s face was swabbed at specific points (around both eyes, the nostrils and the mouth) before and after exposure to each of these respiratory activities, and was cleaned between each activity with medical grade alcohol swabs. Shadowgraph imaging was used to record the generation of these respiratory aerosols from the infected volunteers and their impact onto the target manikin. No influenza RNA was detected from any of these swabs with either team’s in-house diagnostic influenza assays. All the influenza-infected volunteers had diagnostic swabs taken at recruitment that confirmed influenza (A/H1, A/H3 or B) infection with high viral loads, ranging from 105-108 copies/mL (Hong Kong volunteers/assay) and 104–107 copies/mL influenza viral RNA (Singapore volunteers/assay). These findings suggest that influenza RNA may not be readily transmitted from naturally-infected human source to susceptible recipients via these natural respiratory activities, within these exposure time-frames. Various reasons are discussed in an attempt to explain these findings.

description1026=A survey of the status of language usage in Singapore begins with an overview of patterns of usage of Malay, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Tamil. The function of English as a primary language along with the official language, Malay, is discussed, along with the history of the dominance of English since Singapore's role as a British colony despite widespread multilingualism. A matrix follows that rates all of these languages on\: (1) their usage rating using State Department classifications; (2) increase and decrease trends by the year 2000; (3) chief of state use in addressing the populace; (4) use in armed forces, government, court, and diplomatic communications, written and oral; (5) use as a language of instruction or required language in higher education, on the secondary and elementary levels, and in adult education; (6) use in the popular press, radio and television broadcasting, and film; (7) business and professional use, written and oral; (8) use in intellectual circles; (9) the alphabet situation; (10) their status in literature; (11) use in public signs and notices; and (12) the availability of instructional materials and dictionaries for use by English speakers. Explanatory notes give the number and population percentages using the languages, type of alphabets used, and specific instructional material titles. A selected bibliography is also included. (MSE)

description1025=The Educational Research Unit Project ITL2 Study A in Singapore was quasi-experimental research designed to measure the effectiveness of non-traditional personnel and resource material package in developmental career guidance. Comparisons were made between experimental group and control group, and group guidance and individual counseling. The total samples comprised secondary one and two pupils (N\=144) from two government schools in Singapore. A new instrument "Career Self-Concept Checklist" was specially constructed and validated in a pilot study for the pre- and post-test comparisons of treatment effects. The outcomes of this study showed that the package was effective in group guidance, the total sample's (N\=32) gain in mean scores was statistically significant. The gain of mean scores in both Sec 1 and Sec 2 groups was significant. As for the control groups, there were no significant differences of mean scores in both the Bowen Secondary School and Thomson Secondary School groups. The treatment effect of individual counseling (N\=16) using this package was also statistically significant. The mean scores difference in the pre- and post-tests, was a gain of 4.81 points which is slightly greater than the mean scores difference of 3.32 in the group guidance samples (N\=32). As for all the control samples, there were no significant differences of mean scores at all. Generally speaking, the career guidance package has received very favorable responses from its users (teachers and pupils) in the experimental samples. The treatments were successful. (Author)

description1024=Cross-cultural changes were accompanied by the sovereignty transition of Hong Kong during the TIMSS data collection, which triggered migration of intellectual families between Hong Kong and other places. To enhance comparability of the urban setting, this investigation focuses on Singapore and Hong Kong for having similar Chinese majority and colonial history. As both cities were reported having high student performance in science, student self-concept is articulated to examine its reciprocal relationship with science achievement under the context of non-monotonic population transition. The perspectives of comparative education have been gained through the cross-cultural understanding of empirical findings from the trend data analysis. (Contains 3 notes, 3 figures, and 2 tables.)

description1023=The Third International Mathematics and Science Study is the largest and most ambitious study ever undertaken by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. Forty-five countries collected data in more than 30 languages. Five grade levels were tested in the two subject areas. This report describes the science achievement of seventh and eighth graders, emphasizing the results from the eighth-grade assessment. Results are presented for the 41 countries that completed all the steps necessary to appear in this report. Singapore was the top performing country at both grade levels, with Colombia, Kuwait, and South Africa performing at the lowest levels. Perhaps the most striking finding was the large difference in average achievement between the top-performing and bottom-performing countries. Results provided a chain of overlapping countries, with most countries having an average achievement similar to that of a cluster of others, but with large differences between the top and bottom of the chain. In most countries and internationally, boys outperformed girls at both grade levels. The majority of eighth graders in nearly every country indicated that they liked science, but not all students had positive feelings about the subject. Home factors were strongly related to achievement in every participating country, but relationships between science achievement and instructional practices were less clear within and across countries. Six appendixes present information on study methodology and selected achievement results for some countries. (Contains 61 tables, 23 appendix tables, 19 figures, and 1 appendix figure.) (SLD)

description1016=The fundamental theme of these papers is what constitutes the common good and the issues and problems related to the understanding of that common good. Several anthropologists and a political scientist explore this theme in various geographic settings and from many theoretical and methodological perspectives. Among the countries and cultures represented in the compendium are Nigeria, Ghana, Japan, Singapore, Latin America, Chinatown USA, the Circumpolar North, and Canada. Papers include "Planning Nigeria's New Capital City\: Implementation and the Public Good" (Ronald Cohen and John Paden); "Chieftaincy and Constitutionalism in Ghana\: The Case of the Third Republic" (Maxwell Owusu); "The Reduction of Rates of Violent Crime\: Japan since World War II" (Robert J. Smith); "Planners, Householders and Fertility Reduction" (Robert S. Merrill); "Conflict in Chinatown\: Changing Images and Institutions" (Serena Nanda); "Research, Policy and Ideas in Good Currency\: The Squatter Settlement Phenomenon" (Lisa R. Peattie); "Internal Colonialism or Self-Sufficiency? Problems and Prospects in the Circumpolar North" (John Dryzek and Oran R. Young); and "Formulating the Common Interest\: The Role of Structures in Cree Development" (Richard F. Salisbury). (RM)

description1015=This report analyzes teacher education and development policies in countries that participated in the Repeat of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study at the Eighth Grade and scored as well as or higher than the United States, also providing information on the systems of Australia, England, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Singapore. A teacher education and development model guided data collection and analysis. Based on this model, the report is structured around\: control and governance; standards for entrance into and exit from teacher education programs; characteristics of education programs for eighth grade mathematics and science teachers; certification requirements; availability of advanced certification; alternative teacher certification programs; hiring and compensation; and inservice and professional development requirements. The report examines output of these systems in terms of teacher qualifications and teachers' confidence to teach mathematics and science. Results suggest that the United States faces great challenges in meeting the No Child Left Behind Act's requirements. Countries vary with respect to where along the teacher training pipeline they impose pressure points. There is a strong relationship between the number of pressure points with stakes attached and the number of high stakes filters used. Although some principles are successful in other countries, they are not necessarily transferable to the United States. Two appendixes present country demographic profiles and classification rubrics.

description1014=This discussion focuses on reading problems arising when bilingual children must learn two different scripts, and how the nature of the relationship between the two scripts may influence the child's ability to transfer and develop reading skills. First, models of normal and abnormal reading in English are described. The significance of these models for understanding the reading processes for other writing scripts, such as Malay and Chinese, are then considered. Data from a case study of a biscriptal Chinese/English-speaking boy with reading problems in English are then presented and explained with reference to the dual route reading model. The paper concludes by reviewing possible implications for educational assessment and reading remediation in the context of Singapore's predominantly bilingual, biscriptal primary school population.

description1013=In this paper the system of coordination within the broader framework of education and technical manpower training is examined. The development of technical education in the schools and of programs offered by the public institutions is first described. A discussion follows regarding technical manpower training, the responsibility for which lies outside the school system and which is undertaken by different public institutions. Coordination of technical manpower development is considered. The closely linked system of progression between the schools and vocational training is then elaborated upon by focusing attention on the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) in introducing a mechanism of automatic registration and a Pre-Vocational Training (PVT) program. Two tables and three figures are attached that depict areas of study in the technical education program, proposed PVT projects, the system of automatic registration, and features of the MOE-VITB system of progression.

description1006=The psychological and linguistic rationales for an integrative approach to teaching reading and language that is based on the language experience and shared book approaches are presented, and the necessary changes in the Singapore educational system are outlined. Because the program is an integrated language arts approach, reading instruction time is integrated with language learning time, and some blocked periods are scheduled. The implementation strategies include provision for monitoring and feedback from workshop leaders, teachers, and students. Data derived from children's reading and language test performance, classroom observation, and a study of instructional problems faced by teachers in using the approach are analyzed, and recommendations are made.

description1005=John Thomson was a nineteenth-century British photojournalist who used the wet-plate process to illustrate his explorations of eastern and Southeast Asia. His travels from 1862 to 1872 took him to the following places, among others\: Ceylon, Cambodia, Singapore, Thailand, Saigon, Siam, mainland China, and Taiwan. Thomson chose to use the wet-plate process, despite its problems and demands, because of the quality of negative possible. As one of the earliest European photojournalists to work in Asia, Thomson produced work that goes beyond mere documentation; it presents the grandeur of the Asian landscapes and gives probing images of living people that together convey a full sense of the land. He also experienced many difficulties with malaria, hostile people, and harsh climates. He was especially interested in the "small trades" and in anonymous individuals who could not pay for their portraits and who are thus underrepresented in the works of most Victorian photographers. A bibliography of Thomson's work is included. (CC)

description1003=This study, conducted in Singapore, was designed to determine pre-service primary teachers' (n\=34) behavior in asking operational questions in science. In training the pre-service teachers in asking operational questions, the meaning of operational questions was first illustrated and clarified to them through the use of some examples during group activities. The pre-service teachers were then placed in a new situation in which they had to carry out another activity, make observations, and respond to these observed phenomena. Questioning patterns were identified based on their responses. The study revealed that if proper instruction is given, the pre-service teachers' ability to ask operational questions can be trained and developed further. The study concluded that fostering ability in asking quality operational questions, imparting science content knowledge, and enhancing good observational skills are areas to be addressed. The study suggested that the training should start as early as possible and be extended to pre-service secondary science teachers. (MDH)

Encouraged by some of the highest starting salaries available in any industry, record numbers of students are enrolling in petroleum engineering courses at U.S. universities. In the future, Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore, Jakarta Indonesia and many more are amongst with many developing countries in the oil and gas industry. It is part of a broader renaissance in engineering education, which should eventually ease severe skill shortages in the oil and gas sector. But it will be the end of the decade before these new graduates are the experienced professionals needed to lead teams and make a real difference to exploration, output and refining.

description2765=MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington DC, SPECIAL SERIES No. 26, Japanese Tanks And Tank Tactics, November 15, 1944  "The Japanese have made only limited use of tanks up to the present time. In their operations in China, however, they have had an opportunity to utilize tanks much more extensively than elsewhere because of the character of the terrain and the large areas over which the fighting has occurred. As a matter of fact, China has been the great proving ground for Japanese armored vehicles of all types. The Japanese also used light and medium tanks to some extent in the Malayan campaign and in the siege of Singapore, as well as in the Philippines, Burma, Guadalcanal, and Papua. More recently, on Guam and Tinian, comparatively large numbers of Japanese tanks have been in action; on Saipan more than 80 were destroyed, many by aerial and naval bombardment before they could be moved from assembly areas."

description2744=Trends in articulation arrangements for technical and vocational education (TVE) in the South East Asia region were studied. A key feature of articulation is the existence of pathways that allow graduates of one course of study to progress to other courses. Effective articulation opens up advancement for individuals and helps to create a flexible workforce which allows countries to capitalize on opportunities that advance economic growth. Two precursors for effective TVE articulation are (1) general availability of primary and secondary education; and (2) a higher education system that has some capacity to accept other than secondary school graduates into undergraduate courses. Broad availability of TVE/higher education articulation appears to correlate with economies that have a significant services sector, high technology industries and substantial manufacturing capacity and that tend to enhance the status of TVE. (Approximately two thirds of the document consists of country profiles of Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, which include overviews of the economic and educational status of each country, of postsecondary TVE, and of each country's articulation arrangements. Seventy-six endnotes and a list of individuals interviewed are appended.) (CG)

The first issue (No. 68) contains a review of the current status of adult literacy worldwide and articles on an adult literacy program in Nepal; adult new readers as authors; testing literacy materials; the use of hand-held electronic learning aids at the primary level in Belize; the use of public television to promote literacy in the United States; reading programs in Africa and Asia; and discussions of the Laubach and Freirean literacy models. Articles in the second issue (no. 69) discuss the potential of educational technology for improving education; new educational partnerships for providing basic education; gender differences in basic education; a social marketing campaign and guidelines for the improvement of basic education; adaptations of educational television's "Sesame Street" for use in other languages and cultures; and resources on basic education. Women are the focus of the third issue (No. 70), including articles on communicating with women; effective training for women; agricultural extension and African women farmers; hygiene education; ways to increase mothers' self-confidence; and community publishing as a strategy for women's development in Zimbabwe.

description2740=The two papers in this document explain various options and modalities for UNEVOC (International Project on Technical and Vocational Education) Member States' financing of their individual systems of technical and vocational education and disseminating experiences in this area. "Financing Vocational Education and Training in Developing Countries" (Pradeep Bolita) provides a systematic overview of various modalities of public and private finance of technical and vocational education. It describes four of the more well-known financing mechanisms\: public financing, enterprise financing, private and public sponsored financing, and international donor assistance. The advantages and disadvantages of each type are identified and policy implications indicated, with some country examples."Financing Vocational Education\: Concepts, Examples, and Tendencies" (David Atchoarena) draws conclusions from experience with various existing concepts of financing. It first reviews the main issues, such as cost sharing and subsidiarity; apprenticeship; privately financed institutional training; the use of earmarked taxation to finance training; and training funds. It then focuses on selected country experiences, illustrating different kinds of strategies and instruments involved in the financing of vocational education. These countries are highlighted\: Brazil, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Mauritius, and Ivory Coast. A final chapter looks at future trends and variables affecting funding scheme options. (Each paper contains references.) (YLB)

description2737=Thinking and acting strategically about human capital development and management is the lifeblood of most high-performing businesses and organizations. Public education in this nation should be no different. Principals' and teachers' performance has more effect on student achievement than any other factor and their effectiveness in increasing student performance varies widely. Given the stakes, it is imperative to act on that knowledge and strengthen the education workforce to better serve students. Yet, few urban school districts have acted on this knowledge to make strengthening human capital a centerpiece of their improvement strategies. To build knowledge and momentum for new approaches to strengthening human capital in education, the Aspen Institute Program on Education and Society has launched a multi-year effort to examine what a systematic human capital system in education might look like building on best practices in education and business both here and abroad. In fall 2006, the Aspen Program on Education convened a seminar of leading policymakers, researchers and practitioners from eight nations to bring international lessons to U.S. policy conversations. Surveying the international landscape, the participants were struck by Singapore--a city-state with both high student achievement and a coherent, performance-oriented, professionalized approach to teacher development. While culture and context matter and the Singaporean system could not be replicated in the U.S., this report on Singapore provides provocative ideas for how school districts and states might move toward a more systematic career and compensation structure. Appended are\: (1) Singapore and Its Education System; and (2) Description of the Singapore Performance Management Process. [This paper was written with Edmund Lim. It was prepared for the Aspen Institute Education and Society Program.]

description2723=Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has been the most important political personality since he came to power in 1959. This thesis describes and analyzes how he gained power and began to implement his political, social and economic concepts. A third-generation English-educated Straits Chinese, Lee led his young People's Action Party to its first victory in 1955, supported by both Communist and non-Communist elements. His goal was an independent, non-Communist, democratic socialist Singapore once colonialism had been eliminated. The key element in Lee's method was pragmatism rather than rigid ideology. By 1959, Lee was Prime Minister and by 1961, he had rid the Party of pro-Communists. Careful, thorough planning, realistic economic policies, honest administration and outstanding political skill enabled Lee and his moderate colleagues to surmount the shock of eviction from Malaysia and the British withdrawal of military forces.

description2712=This is the first in a series of reports from the Center on International Education Benchmarking (CIEB) exploring the leading vocational and technical education systems from around the world to draw out what makes these systems great and what other countries can learn from them. This first report was based on a visit of several days to Singapore made by Betsy Brown Ruzzi, Vivien Stewart and Marc S, Tucker in May-June 2012. The remarkable Singaporean achievement in vocational education and training stands as a powerhouse at the intersection between East and West. This report concentrates on the policies and structures that define the vocational educational and training (VET) system of Singapore. It describes not only what it looks like now, but also how it developed, stage by stage, in relation to Singapore's economic development program and its unfolding general education system.
description2711=Curriculum is a crucial component of any educational process. Curriculum development and instructional management serve as effective tools for meeting the present and future needs of the local and national communities. In trying to strengthen the quality assurance system in Philippine higher education, institutions of higher learning were mandated to upgrade higher education curricular offerings to international standards. Anchored on the PMI framework, data were gathered through in-depth review of documents, interviews with program coordinators and on-site observation in selected schools offering Medical Technology program in U.S.A., Australia, Singapore, Japan, Thailand and Canada. The benchmarking results showed that there were major "plus" and "interesting" points that can be used as guide in the innovation of the existing Philippine Medical Technology program and can become the basis of enabling implementation activities\: reform and improve curriculum structure, content, teaching- learning strategies and employ competency-based assessment process.
description2710=The IEA Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M) is the first large-scale international study of the preparation of primary and lower-secondary teachers. The study investigated the pedagogical and subject-specific knowledge that future primary and lower secondary school teachers acquire during their mathematics teacher education. It also examined variations in teacher education programs within and across countries. TEDS-M gathered data in 2008 from approximately 22,000 future teachers from 750 programs in about 500 teacher education institutions in 17 countries\: Botswana, Canada (four provinces), Chile, Chinese Taipei, Georgia, Germany, Malaysia, Norway, Oman (secondary teacher education), the Philippines, Poland, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain (primary teacher education), Switzerland (German-speaking cantons), Thailand, and the United States of America (public institutions, concurrent and consecutive routes only). Teaching staff within these programs (close to 5,000 mathematics and general pedagogy educators) were also surveyed. This encyclopedia provides a resource that readers can draw from when analyzing the context-based similarities and differences that are important to keep in mind when interpreting and explaining the TEDS-M results. The encyclopedia thus strengthens the reporting of this first international assessment of teacher education. It presents a broader context within which the data collected from future teachers and their educators can be understood and interpreted. Elements of this context include information about countries' distinctive political, historical, and cultural contexts that influence policy and practice in mathematics teacher education. It also describes the organization and characteristics of teacher education in the participating countries, the institutions that teach future teachers and their staff, the programs and required field experiences, and the quality-assurance arrangements. In combination with the TEDS-M international and policy reports, the TEDS-M encyclopedia is a useful resource for policy development and further research on teacher education. Following an introduction by John Schwille and Lawrence Ingvarson, chapters in the encyclopedia include\: (1) Botswana (Kgomotso Gertrude Garegae, Thabo Jeff Mzwinila, and Tuelo Martin Keitumetse); (2) Canada (New Foundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Québec, and Ontario) (Robert Crocker and Hervé Joduin); (3) Chile Beatrice (Avalos Davidson); (4) Chinese Taipei (Feng-Juh Hsieh, Pe-Jen Lin, Guohong Chao, and Ting-Ying Wang); (5) Georgia (Natia Mzhavanadze and Tamara Bokuchava); (6) Germany (Johannes König and Sigrid Blömeke); (7) Malaysia (Rajendran Nagappan, Nagendralingan Ratnavadivel, Mohd Mustamam Abd Karim, Othman Lebar, Ismail Kailani, and Suseela Malakolunthu); (8) Norway (Trygve Breiteig); (9) Oman (Mohammed Al Ghafri, Ali Al Abri, and Mohamed Al Shidhani); (10) Philippines (Ester B. Ogena, Filma G. Brawner, and Milagros D. Ibe); (11) Poland (Michal Sitek); (12) Russian Federation; (13) Singapore (Khoon Yoong Wong, Suat Khoh Lim-Teo, Ngan Hoe Lee, Kok Leong Boey, Caroline Koh, Jagusthing Dindyal, Kok Ming Teo, and Lu Pien Cheng); (14) Spain (Encarnación Castro Martínez and Pablo Flores Martínez); (15) Switzerland (Sandra Brandt, Fritz Oser, Horst Biedermann, Margit Kopp, Sibylle Steinmann, Samuel Krattenmacher, and Christian Brühwiler); (16) Thailand (Precharn Dechsri and Supattra Pativisan); and (17) United States of America (USA) (Peter Youngs and Erin Grogan). An appendix presents\: Listings of Organizations and Individuals Responsible for TEDS-M. (Individual chapters contain references.) [The international TEDS-M team at Michigan State University (MSU) in the United States, the Australian Council for Educational Research, the IEA Data Processing and Research Center (DPC) in Hamburg, and the IEA Secretariat in Amsterdam shaped the overall TEDS-M survey and developed a framework, terminology, and design that ultimately had a strong effect on what went into these chapters.]

description2677=Secondary school students in Singapore are expected to find an expression for the general or "nth" term of an arithmetic progression (AP) without using the AP formula T[subscript n] \= a + (n-1)d, where "a" is the first term, "n" is the number of terms and "d" is the common difference between successive terms. This type of question is worth only one mark in the GCE O-Level Examination but the usual method taught in school is far too long and many students feel that it is not worth trying so hard for one mark. This led the author, when he was a teacher, to look for other shorter methods. In this article, he will discuss five methods to find an expression for the "nth" term of an AP, including arguably the fastest method that he has invented. He believes teachers will not only find the "fastest" method useful for their students but they can also challenge their students to be innovative and creative\: find as many methods as possible to find the general term of an AP.

I therefore pray most humbly, and ask my gentle readers to also kindly join in the prayer, that Allah Most High might protect books (such as this humble quartet of books on Surah al-Kahf) that use the blessed Qur'an to explain, to expose and to challenge those in the godless modern age who are waging wicked war on Islam. Amin. This first volume of four, containing 'Text Translation and Modern Commentary of Surah al-Kahf', makes its appearance just before our main work on the subject entitled 'Surah al-Kahf and the Modern Age' is to be published, and is meant to function as a companion volume to that main work. We propose, Insha Allah, to publish a third and fourth volume on this subject in which we would like to offer to the reading public a comprehensive and credible modern interpretation of the Ahadith and Qur'anic verses dealing (directly and indirectly) with the critically important topics of Dajjal the false Messiah or Anti-Christ, and of Gog and Magog. If any such books have already been written and published, they must be very few indeed. And so the four volumes would have the following titles\: Â· Volume One\: 'Surah al-Kahf\: Text Translation and Modern Commentary'; Â· Volume Two\: 'Surah al-Kahf and the Modern Age'; Â· Volume Three\: 'Dajjal the False Messiah or Anti-Christ'; Â· Volume Four\: 'Gog and Magog in the Qur'an and Hadith' The writing of all four volumes on Surah al-Kahf was kindly sponsored in the names of a number of people in different parts of the world as follows\: Rabia Aboobakar Hussein Jakhura and Aboobakar Hussein Jakhura of Malawi in Africa, Abdul Majid Kader Sultan and Fatimah Abdullah of Malaysia and Hajjah Haniffa Bte Omar Khan Sourattee and Allahyarhama Hajjah Mariam Bte Fakir Mohammed of Singapore. May Allah Most Kind bless them, have mercy on their souls and forgive them their sins. Amin\! Imran N. Hosein In the island of Trinidad. August 2006

description2651=Thesis Advisor(s)\: Phillip E. Pace\n"March 1998."\nThesis (M.S. in Electrical Engineering) Naval Postgraduate School, March 1998\nIncludes bibliographical references (p. 47-48)\nThe objective of this study is to verify the Symmetrical Number System (SNS) undersampling receiver architecture using software and to investigate implementation issues using digital signal processing (DSP) hardware. In the software design, a MATLAB program is written to determine a single sinusoidal input frequency using this receiver architecture. Each channel of the SNS undersampling receiver consists of a low speed ADC, a discrete Fourier transform followed by a constant threshold device to detect the signal's frequency bin. The detected frequency bins are then recombined in a SNS-to-decimal algorithm to recover the frequency of the signal. Error rate performance in a Gaussian noise environment at the input stage is evaluated. In the hardware design, a sinusoidal waveform is digitized, discrete Fourier transformed and converted from the SNS format to a decimal value using a single channel digital signal processor. Implementation difficulties and design issues are discussed\nMode of access\: World Wide Web\nSystem requirements\: Adobe Acrobat reader\nRepublic of Singapore Airforce author\ndk/dk cc\:9116 7/1/98\n
